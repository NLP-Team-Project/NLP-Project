If anyone wants to work on a particular league or competition please let me know.  These are the things I'd like to work on:\n\n- English League Cup  - data from the league cup is included but still is missing some fields. For instance the aet and pens and also northsouth data are missing. Data also generally needs checking.\n- European competitions - don't currently have this data\n- English Conference - need to add dates to results for seasons 1979/80-1998/98.\n- English FA Cup pre-qualifying round - also no data yet.\n- English other competitions - e.g. lower league cup competitions - no data yet.\n- Points deductions -  a list of points deductions of teams in each Euro league over time to make tables more accurate\n- Tie-breaking procedures - different Euro leagues have had different tie-breaking procedures over time. Having a record of this will help with making the `maketable` family of funcitons\n- Italian League in the early years - I think the first few seasons of the league need to be triple checked.\n- Double checking of consistency of teamnames in all leagues - e.g. French teams have split/diverged a lot since 1933, are they all named correctly?\n-  Promotion/Relegation Playoff Results for European Leagues.\n-  Extending results for Scotland, Portugal, Belgium, Turkey, Greece prior to 1994/1995.\n-  For MLS 1996-1999, correct FT scores to account for which games ended in ties and were decided by shoot-outs.\n\n\n\n## Functions \n\nSome built-in functions:\n\n-  england_current().r       - get results from top 4 tiers of English football from current season.  Other current seasons for other datasets can be got by e.g. holland_current(), germany_current() etc.\n\n-  maketable.r               - make a league table  - probably the quickest way to make a league table\n\n-  maketable_eng.r           - make a league table that follows the tie-breaking and points procedures for each season. \n\n-  maketable_all.r           - make a league table between dates or only for home/away results. \n\n-  games_between.r           - returns all games ever played between two teams\n\n-  games_between_sum.r       - returns the summary of results between any two teams\n\n-  alltimerecord.r           - returns the all time record of any team in the league\n\n-  score_most.r              - returns the team who has been involved in the most games of each scoreline\n\n-  score_teamX.r             - Lists all matches that a team has played in that ended in a specific scoreline\n\n-  score_team.r              - List all occurrences of a specific scoreline for a specific team\n\n-  scoreline_by_team.r      - How often each team has a won,lost,drawn by a scoreline? \n\n-  totalgoals_by_team.r     - Return all instances of a team being involved in a game with n goals\n\n-  ngoals.r                 - Return number of times a team has scored n goals\n\n-  n_offs.r                 - Will return the scorelines that have occurred n number of times\n\n-  opponentfreq.r           - Return how often a team has played each opponent\n\n-  opponents.r              - number of unique opponents for all teams in total or by tier\n\n-  bestwins.r               - best wins for each team\n\n-  worstlosses.r            - worst losses for each team\n\n-  homeaway.r               - very useful function to get home & away results with each team listed in 'team' column \n\n\n\n## What does england.csv contain?\n\nall top 4 tier games ever played 1888-2020\n\n- FL = Football League\n- PL = Premier League\n\n- 1888/9-1891/2   FL Division 1\n- 1892/3-1914/5   FL Divisions 1 & 2\n- 1919/20           FL Divisions 1 & 2\n- 1920/21           FL Divisions 1, 2 & 3\n- 1921/22-1938/9   FL Divisions 1, 2, 3a North & 3b South\n- 1939              FL Divisions 1, 2, 3a North & 3b South (truncated season)\n- 1946/7-1957/8   FL Divisions 1, 2, 3a North & 3b South\n- 1958/9-1991/2   FL Divisions 1, 2, 3 & 4\n- 1992/3-2004/5   PL, FL Divisions 1, 2 & 3\n- 2004/5-present   PL, FL Championship, FL Divisions 1 & 2\n \n In the csv file, I've used divisions 1,2,3,3a,3b, 4 as the notation\n I've also used tier 1,2,3,4  - to refer to 3,3a & 3b all belonging to tier 3\n\n \nDataset includes:\n \n teams that dropped out half way through a season:\n - 1919 Leeds City\n - 1931 Wigan Borough\n - 1961 Accrington Stanley\n\n - includes 1919 Port Vale who replaced Leeds City mid-season\n \n- The truncated 1939/40 season is in a separate file england1939.csv\n\n  Team Names used in the file are those that are currently used:\n  e.g. Small Heath are Birmingham City, Ardwick are Manchester City, etc.\n  \n  The modern Accrington Stanley are 'Accrington' to distinguish from original Accrington Stanley and earlier Accrington FC\n  \n\n\n\n## What does facup.csv contain?\n\nThis was a pain to put together.  It contains every single FA Cup tie (whether played or not) from the first inception of the competition in 1871 to the 2015/16 season.  It does not contain pre-qualifying rounds (yet).   It is best to describe each variable name in turn to give more information:\n\n- date         - date of match/tie\n- Season       - season (e.g. 1872 refers to 1872/73 season)\n- home         - home team (note for games played at neutral venues this isn't relevant)\n- visitor      - visiting team (note for games played at neutral venues this isn't relevant)\n- FT           - final score.  this is the final score even after extra time (i.e. not just after 90 minutes)\n- hgoal        - number of goals scored by team in home variable\n- vgoal        - number of goals scored by team in visitor variable\n- round        - the round of the match (1,2,3,4,5,6, s = semi-final, f=final, 3pp = 3rd place playoff)\n- tie          - initial = 1st game, replay = 1st replay, replay2 = 2nd replay, etc.\n- aet          - whether the game went to extra time. note only 'yes' or NA. \n- pen          - whether the game went to penalties.  note only 'yes' or NA.\n- pens         - the scoreline of the penalty shoot-out and who won\n- hp           - penalties scored in a shoot-out by team in home variable\n- vp           - penalties scored in a shoot-out by team in visitor variable\n- Venue        - where match was played\n- attendance   - attendance of the match\n- nonmatch     - if a tie was not played, voided or a team disqualified\n- notes        - further information about non-matches\n- neutral      - was the game played at a neutral venue -  \"yes\" or NA.\n\n\nImportant notes to above:\n\nI have tried to make the dataset as complete as possible.  The FA Cup data is difficult as some of it is just unobtainable.  For instance, I have added venues and attendances for all semis and finals and have included this information sporadically wherelse I was able to get it.  I have not done a systematic application of this to early rounds.   Several games in the FA Cup are played at neutral grounds or even the visiting team is allowed to play at home (e.g. if a minnow plays a big team).  I have not managed to systematically check this.   Also, there was a trend to play 2nd and 3rd and 4th replays at neutral venues.  This could be systematically checked but I have not yet.      Further, I think I have all games that ever ended in penalties added in correctly.  \n\nFinally, team names.  There are great disputes about which teams branch off from which teams in history and who should have shared history.  I have tried to be consistent in naming teams with their most current name throughout (e.g. Millwall Rovers, Millwall Athletic and Millwall are all listed as the current name - Millwall), or the name that they used when they stopped playing (e.g. Mitchell St. George's are always listed as Birmingham St. George's).     I have also tried to follow the same team name format as in england.csv  - I think the three Accrington teams may be the only one I need to re-edit for this purpose. \n\n\n\n## What does playoffs.csv contain?\n\n* all test-matches used to decide relegation/promotion between old division 1 and old division 2 1892/93 - 1897/98\n* all modern playoffs used to decide relegation/promotion since 1986/87\n* division of team in playoff is noted as well as the divisional playoffs each tie belongs to\n* all dates of matches included\n\n\n\n## What does spain.csv contain?\n\n* top flight matches 1929 - present\n* The 1929 season only took place in 1929 but is denoted as 1928 Season in keeping with the package's style format.  The 1929/30 season is noted as 1929\n* Promotion/relegation matches are not included - will be in a separate csv soon\n* 1979/80 season does not include \"CD M\u00e1laga 0-3 UD Salamanca\" match that was annulled because of match fixing\n* 1979/80 season does include  \"CD M\u00e1laga 0-1 AD Almer\u00eda\" that was not played but awarded 0-1 to AD Almer\u00eda as CD M\u00e1laga failed to participate\n* All team names are the currently used ones - i.e. names used during the Spanish civil war are not used.\n* The 1986/87 season contains both the phase 1 round of games and the phase 2 round of games.  \n\nPlease refer to the spainliga rpubs below for further information.\n\n\n\n## Other Leagues:\n\nI've added complete all top tier results for Holland (1956-present), Germany (1963-present), Italy (1934-present), France (1933-present). Additionally all tier 2 results for Germany. Finally, we have results from the all tiers of Scotland, and top tier of  Belgium, Turkey, Greece, Portugal since 1994/1995.\n\nThese dataframes contain all league results played in regular season.  They don't yet include relegation/promotion playoff fixtures.  Further, I have not yet completed all final checks of the data.

        "repo": "/bttmly/nba",
        "language": "JavaScript",
        "readme_contents": "# nba\n*Node.js client for nba.com API endpoints*\n\n`npm install nba`\n\n## NOTES:\n\n### BLACKLISTED IP ADDRESSES:\nIt appears as though the NBA has blacklisted certain blocks of IP addresses, specifically those of cloud hosting providers including AWS. As such, you may hit a situation where an application using this package works fine on your local machine, but doesn't work at all when deployed to a cloud server. Annoyingly, requests from these IPs seem to just hang. More information [here](https://github.com/bttmly/nba/issues/41) and [here](https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py/issues/88) -- the second issue has a `curl` command somewhere which will quickly tell you if NBA is accepting requests from your IP. (Incidentally, this is also the same reason the TravisCI build is always \"broken\" but tests all pass locally). There is a simple pass-through server in `scripts/proxy` that can be used to get around this restriction; you can put the proxy server somewhere that can reach NBA.com (e.g. not on AWS or Heroku or similar) and host your actual application on a cloud provider.\n\n### CORS restrictions on browser usage\nThis package can't be used directly from the browser because of [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) restrictions imposed by nba.com. If you run some sort of intermediate server which relays requests to NBA.com, you can change the host the client points to by following the instructions in the *Transport Layer* section\n\n## NBA API\nThe [stats.nba.com](http://stats.nba.com) uses a large number of undocumented JSON endpoints to provide the statistics tables and charts displayed on that website. This library provides a JavaScript client for interacting with many of those API endpoints.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n`NBA.findPlayer(str)` will return an object with a player's name, their ID, and their team information. This method is built into the package.\n\nAll methods in the `NBA.stats` namespace require an object to be passed in as a parameter. The keys to the object are in the docs for the `stats` namespace [here](doc/stats.md)\n\n```js\nconst NBA = require(\"nba\");\nconst curry = NBA.findPlayer('Stephen Curry');\nconsole.log(curry);\n/* logs the following:\n{\n  firstName: 'Stephen',\n  lastName: 'Curry',\n  playerId: 201939,\n  teamId: 1610612744,\n  fullName: 'Stephen Curry',\n  downcaseName: 'stephen curry'\n}\n*/\nNBA.stats.playerInfo({ PlayerID: curry.playerId }).then(console.log);\n```\n\nFor more example API calls, see `/test/integration/stats.js` and other test files.\n\n## Stability Warning\nThis is a client for an unstable and undocumented API. While I try to follow [semver](http://semver.org/) for changes to the JavaScript API this library exposes, the underlying HTTP API can (and has) changed without warning. In particular, the NBA has repeatedly deprecated endpoints, or added certain required headers without which requests will fail. Further, this library comes bundled with a (relatively) up-to-date list of current NBA players which is subject to change at any time -- the specific contents of it should not be considered part of this library's API contract.\n\n## Usability\nTo put it nicely, the NBA's API endpoints are a little clunky to work with. This library tries to strike a balance between being usable but not making assumptions about how the data will be used. Specifically, the NBA sends data in a concise \"table\" form where the column headers come first then each result is an array of values that need to be matched with the proper header. This library does a simple transformation to zip the header and values arrays into a header-keyed object. Beyond that, it tries to not do too much. This is important to note because sometimes the various \"result sets\" that come back on a single endpoint seem sort of arbitrary. The underlying HTTP API doesn't seem to follow standard REST practices; rather it seems the endpoints are tied directly to the data needed by specific tables and charts displayed on [stats.nba.com](). This is what I mean by \"clunky\" to work with -- it can be tricky to assemble the data you need for a specific analysis from the various endpoints available.\n\n## Documentation\n_still lots to do here..._\n\nThere are four primary parts of this library\n- *Top-level methods*\n- *`stats` namespace* &mdash; [docs](https://github.com/bttmly/nba/blob/master/doc/stats.md)\n- *`synergy` namespace* [see tests](https://github.com/bttmly/nba/blob/master/test/integration/synergy.js)\n\u2013 *`data` namespace* [see tests](https://github.com/bttmly/nba/blob/master/test/integration/data.js)\n- *~`sportVu` namespace*~ NBA has removed sportVu endpoints. the methods exist here for backwards compatibility but they throw errors\n\n## Transport Layer\nIn some cases you will want to use a different transport layer to handle HTTP requests. Perhaps you have an HTTP client library you like better than what I used here. Better yet, you want to get stats for the WNBA or the G League. The following code snippet shows how to use the `withTransport` method to create a new client with your own transport function.\n\n```js\n// here we are getting stats for the WNBA!\n\nconst nba = require(\"nba\");\nconst getJSON = require(\"nba/src/get-json\");\n\n// for the G League, try \"stats.gleague.nba.com\"\nconst newHost = \"stats.wnba.com\";\n\nconst transport = (url, params, options) => {\n  // simply swap the host and then defer the rest to the built in getJSON function\n  const fixedURL = url.replace(\"stats.nba.com\", \"stats.wnba.com\");\n  return getJSON(fixedURL, params, options);\n};\n\n// create a new stats client here with our WNBA transport\nconst wnbaStats = nba.stats.withTransport(transport);\n\n(async () => {\n  const result = await wnbaStats.playerInfo({ PlayerID: \"1628886\" });\n  console.log(result);\n})();\n```\n\n## \"I don't use Node.js\"\nPlease take a look at [nba-client-template](http://github.com/bttmly/nba-client-template). The relevant part of the repo is a single JSON document from which many programming languages can dynamically generate an API client. The repo contains (sloppy) examples in [Ruby](https://github.com/bttmly/nba-client-template/blob/master/example-clients/simple-client.rb) and [Python](https://github.com/bttmly/nba-client-template/blob/master/example-clients/simple-client.py). Compiled languages can use code generation techniques to the same effect -- there's a (again, sloppy) example in [Go](https://github.com/bttmly/nba-client-template/tree/master/example-clients/golang). If you'd like me to publish it to a specific registry so you can install it with your language's package manager, please [open an issue](http://github.com/bttmly/nba-client-template/issues). Please note, however, that package only includes  the endpoints exposed by this library under the `stats` namespace -- `sportvu` and `synergy` endpoints aren't yet included in it. I also plan to add a command-line interface to this library so that it can be easily driven as a child process by another program.\n\n##\n"

Displays a live scoreboard for your team's game on that day.\n\nRequires a Raspberry Pi and an LED board hooked up via the GPIO pins.\n\n**Currently supported boards:**\n * 32x32 (Limited number of features)\n * 64x32 (the _most_ supported)\n * 64x64\n * 128x32\n * 128x64\n\nIf you'd like to see support for another set of board dimensions, or have design suggestions for an existing one, file an issue!\n\n**Pi's with known issues**\n * Raspberry Pi Zero has had numerous reports of slowness and unreliability during installation and running the software.\n\n## Table of Contents\n* [Features](#features)\n  * [Live Games](#live-games)\n  * [Pregame](#pregame)\n  * [Division Standings](#division-standings)\n* [Installation](#installation)\n  * [Hardware Assembly](#hardware-assembly)\n  * [Software Installation](#software-installation)\n* [Usage](#usage)\n  * [Configuration](#configuration)\n  * [Flags](#flags)\n* [Personalization](#personalization)\n  * [Custom Board Layout](#custom-board-layout)\n  * [Custom Colors](#custom-colors)\n* [Sources](#sources)\n  * [Accuracy Disclaimer](#accuracy-disclaimer)\n* [Wiki](https://github.com/MLB-LED-Scoreboard/mlb-led-scoreboard/wiki)\n* [Help and Contributing](#help-and-contributing)\n  * [Latest Features](#latest-features)\n* [Licensing](#licensing)\n* [Other cool projects](#other-cool-projects)\n\n## Features\n\n### Live Games\nIt can display live games in action, and optionally rotate every 15 seconds through each game of the day.\n\nThe board refreshes the list of games every 15 minutes.\n\n<a href=\"assets/img/cubs-indians-demo.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"Cubs-Indians game\" width=\"auto\" height=\"200\" src=\"assets/img/cubs-indians-demo.jpg\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"assets/img/pirates-cubs-demo.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"Pirates-Cubs game\" width=\"auto\" height=\"200\" src=\"assets/img/pirates-cubs-demo.jpg\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"assets/img/wide-final-demo.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"Cubs-Braves Final\" width=\"auto\" height=\"200\" src=\"assets/img/wide-final-demo.jpg\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"assets/img/64x64-live.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"64x64 example\" width=\"auto\" height=\"200\" src=\"assets/img/64x64-live.jpg\">\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"assets/img/wide-ingame-demo.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"Giants-Brewers-wide game\" width=\"auto\" height=\"200\" src=\"assets/img/wide-ingame-demo.jpg\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"assets/img/128x32-live.png\">\n  <img alt=\"Tigers-Royals game\" width=\"auto\" height=\"200\" src=\"assets/img/128x32-live.png\">\n</a>\n\n### Pregame\nIf a game hasn't started yet, a pregame screen will be displayed with the probable starting pitchers.\n\n<a href=\"assets/img/pregame.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"Pregame\" width=\"auto\" height=\"200\" src=\"assets/img/pregame.jpg\"></a>\n<a href=\"assets/img/128x64.png\">\n  <img alt=\"Astros-Athletics pregame\" width=\"auto\" height=\"200\" src=\"assets/img/128x64.png\"></a>\n\n### Division Standings\nIt can display standings for the provided division. Since the 32x32 board is too small to display wins and losses together, the wins and losses are alternated on the board every 5 seconds. You can also specify \"NL Wild Card\" or \"AL Wild Card\" as a 'division' to see the top 5 teams in each league's wild card race.\n\n<a href=\"assets/img/standings-wins.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"standings-wins\" width=\"auto\" height=\"200\" src=\"assets/img/standings-wins.jpg\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"assets/img/standings-losses.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"standings-losses\" width=\"auto\" height=\"200\" src=\"assets/img/standings-losses.jpg\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"assets/img/wide-standings-demo.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"standings-wide\" width=\"auto\" height=\"200\" src=\"assets/img/wide-standings-demo.jpg\">\n</a>\n\n## Installation\n### Hardware Assembly\n[See the wiki page for the original project for a step-by-step guide.](https://github.com/MLB-LED-Scoreboard/mlb-led-scoreboard/wiki) This README is primarily focused on the MLB software, but for those coming here from Reddit or elsewhere never having built things with a Raspberry Pi, this should help get you going.\n\nA sample bill of materials (BOM) is located [here](https://www.adafruit.com/wishlists/527606)\n\n### Software Installation\n#### Requirements\nYou need Git for cloning this repo and PIP for installing the scoreboard software.\n```\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install git python3-pip\n```\n\n#### Installing the scoreboard software\nThis installation process will take about 10-15 minutes. Raspberry Pis aren't the fastest of computers, so be patient!\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/MLB-LED-Scoreboard/mlb-led-scoreboard.git\ncd mlb-led-scoreboard/\nsudo ./install.sh\n```\n\nThis will install the rgbmatrix binaries, which we get from [another open source library](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/tree/master/bindings/python#building). It controls the actual rendering of the scoreboard onto the LEDs. If you're curious, you can read through their documentation on how all of the lower level stuff works.\n\nIt will also install the following python libraries that are required for certain parts of the scoreboard to function.\n\n* [tzlocal](https://github.com/regebro/tzlocal): Timezone libraries. These allow the scoreboard to convert times to your local timezone\n* [feedparser](https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/): Used to fetch and parse RSS feeds. The scoreboard uses this to show news headlines.\n* [pyowm](https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm): OpenWeatherMap API interactions. We use this to get the local weather for display on the offday screen. For more information on how to finish setting up the weather, visit the [weather section](#weather) of this README.\n* [MLB-StatsAPI](https://pypi.org/project/MLB-StatsAPI/): The main library that fetches and parses all of the actual MLB data being displayed\n* [RGBMatrixEmulator](https://github.com/ty-porter/RGBMatrixEmulator): The emulation library for the matrix display. Useful for running on MacOS or Linux, or for development.\n\n#### Installation on Non-Raspberry Pi Hardware\n\nThe installation script is designed for physical hardware. When attempting to install it on other platforms, you should not use `sudo` to install the dependencies. In addition, you can pass the `--emulator-only` argument to skip installation steps that aren't required.\n\n```\nsh install.sh --emulator-only\n```\n\nAdditional flags are available for customizing your install:\n\n```\n-p, --skip-python  Skips Python 3 installation. You will need to install it via your platform's appropriate package manager.\n-m, --skip-matrix  Skips RPI-specific matrix driver installation and build.\n-c, --skip-config  Skips default config overwrite without prompting.\n\n-a, --skip-all     Performs all above skips.\n\n--emulator-only    Do not install dependencies under sudo. Skips building matrix dependencies.\n\n-h, --help         Displays help\n```\n\n#### Updating\n* Run `git pull` in your mlb-led-scoreboard folder to fetch the latest changes. A lot of the time, this will be enough, but if something seems broken:\n    * **Re-run the install file**. Run `sudo ./install.sh` again. Any additional dependencies that were added with the update will be installed this way. If you are moving to a new major release version, answer \"Y\" to have it make you a new config file.\n    * **Check your custom layout/color files if you made any**. There's a good chance some new keys were added to the layout and color files. These changes should just merge right in with the customized .json file you have but you might want to look at the new .json.example files and see if there's anything new you want to customize.\n\nThat should be it! Your latest version should now be working with whatever new fangled features were just added.\n\n#### Version Information\n\nYou can check the version information for your installation of mlb-led-scoreboard by running `python3 version.py`.\n\nThe latest version of the software is available [here](https://github.com/MLB-LED-Scoreboard/mlb-led-scoreboard/releases).\n\n#### Time Zones\nMake sure your Raspberry Pi's timezone is configured to your local time zone. They'll often have London time on them by default. You can change the timezone of your raspberry pi by running `sudo raspi-config`.\n\n## Usage\n`sudo python3 main.py` Running as root is 100% an absolute must, or the matrix won't render.\n\n**Adafruit HAT/Bonnet users: You must supply a command line flag:**\n\n`sudo python3 main.py --led-gpio-mapping=\"adafruit-hat\"`\n\nSee the Flags section below for more flags you can optionally provide.\n\n### Running on Other Platforms\n\nThe scoreboard can run on other platforms by means of software emulation via `RGBMatrixEmulator`. When running via the emulator, you do not need to prepend your startup commands with `sudo`:\n\n```sh\npython3 main.py\n```\n\nYou can also force the scoreboard into emulation mode by using the `--emulated` flag:\n\n```sh\npython3 main.py --emulated\n```\n\nWhen running in emulation mode, you can continue to use your existing command line flags as normal.\n\nSee [RGBMatrixEmulator](https://github.com/ty-porter/RGBMatrixEmulator) for emulator configuration options.\n\n### Configuration\n\nA default `config.json.example` file is included for reference. Copy this file to `config.json` and modify the values as needed.\n\n```\n\"preferred\":                             Options for team and division preference\n  \"teams\"                        Array   An array of preferred teams.

A value of `false` will disable demo mode.\n```\n\n### Delaying Board Update\n* The \"preferred_game_update_delay_in_10s_of_seconds\" will delay the update of your LED board to allow you to synchronize with the boroadcast feed.\n* You can only delay the board in 10 second increments, so a value of 3 coresponds to 30 seconds, 5 to 50 seconds etc.\n* There appears to be a lot of variability in broadcast delays across networks/teams/CDN's.\n* Please note, that if restarting the service with a delay, it will take the value of cycles set for the board to be in sync.  If you set the value to 3, it will take 30-40 seconds for the buffer to fill and the board to delay.\n\n### Additional Features\n* Runs/Hits/Errors - Runs are always shown on the games screen, but you can enable or adjust spacing of a \"runs, hits, errors\" display.  Take a look at the [coordinates readme file](/coordinates/README.md) for details.\n\n* Pitch Data - Pitch data can be shown on the game screen, See the [coordinates readme file](/coordinates/README.md) for details. In addition, the `short` and `long` pitch description can be changed in data/pitches.py\n\n* Previous Play Data - Data for the previous play can be shown on the game screen. See the [coordinates readme file](/coordinates/README.md) for details. Long and short play descriptions can be changed in data/plays.py\n  * **NOTE:** Because play result data is ephemeral, not every play result will be displayed. Situations like a mound visit, injury, or other timeout immediately following a play often cause the play result to be immediately replaced on the MLB API. \n\n### Flags\n\nYou can configure your LED matrix with the same flags used in the [rpi-rgb-led-matrix](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix) library. More information on these arguments can be found in the library documentation.\n```\n--led-rows                Display rows. 16 for 16x32, 32 for 32x32.

See the `coordinates/` directory for more information.\n\n### Custom Colors\nYou have the ability to customize the colors of everything on the board. See the `colors/` directory for more information.\n\n### Weather\nThis scoreboard will use a weather API to gather weather information at various times. This information is displayed on your teams' offdays for your area and also displayed during each game's pregame information. The weather API we use is from OpenWeatherMaps. OpenWeatherMaps API requires an API key to fetch this data so you will need to take a quick minute to sign up for an account and copy your own API key into your `config.json`.\n\nYou can find the signup page for OpenWeatherMaps at [https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up). Once logged in, you'll find an `API keys` tab where you'll find a default key was already created for you. You can copy this key and paste it into the `config.json` under `\"weather\"`, `\"apikey\"`.\n\nYou can change the location used by entering your city, state, and country code separated by commas. If you wish to use metric measurements, set the `\"metric\"` option to `true`.\n\n## Sources\nThis project relies on two libraries:\n[MLB-StatsAPI](https://pypi.org/project/MLB-StatsAPI/) is the Python library used for retrieving live game data.\n[rpi-rgb-led-matrix](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix) is the library used for making everything work with the LED board.\n\n### Accuracy Disclaimer\nThe scoreboard updates frequently, but it cannot retrieve information that MLB has not yet made available. If something is odd or it seems behind, the first suspect is the MLB web API.\n\n## Help and Contributing\nIf you run into any issues and have steps to reproduce, open an issue. If you have a feature request, open an issue. If you want to contribute a small to medium sized change, open a pull request. If you want to contribute a new feature, open an issue first before opening a PR.\n\n### Updating Dependencies\n\nDependencies requirements are managed using `pipreqs`. If you are adding or making a change to a dependency (such as updating its version), make sure to update the requirements file with `pipreqs`:\n\n```sh\n# If not already installed\npip3 install pipreqs\n\npipreqs . --force\n```\n\n## Licensing\nThis project as of v1.1.0 uses the GNU Public License. If you intend to sell these, the code must remain open source.\n\n## Other Cool Projects\nThe original version of this board\n\nInspired by this board, check out the [NHL scoreboard](https://github.com/riffnshred/nhl-led-scoreboard) \ud83c\udfd2\n"

Ventura (Royals) - Losing Pitcher: C. Wilson (Angels)\n\nYou can easily print a list of the Mets batters\nin the final game of the 2015 World Series:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nimport mlbgame\n\ngame = mlbgame.day(2015, 11, 1, home='Mets')[0]\nstats = mlbgame.player_stats(game.game_id)\nfor player in stats.home_batting:\n    print(player)\n```\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n    Curtis Granderson (RF)\n    David Wright (3B)\n    Daniel Murphy (2B)\n    Yoenis Cespedes (CF)\n    Juan Lagares (CF)\n    Lucas Duda (1B)\n    Travis d'Arnaud (C)\n    Michael Conforto (LF)\n    Wilmer Flores (SS)\n    Matt Harvey (P)\n    Jeurys Familia (P)\n    Kelly Johnson (PH)\n    Jonathon Niese (P)\n    Addison Reed (P)\n    Bartolo Colon (P)\n"

Please consider\nopening a pull request for any new features or bug fixes to be reviewed and\nmerged.**\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/workflows/Sportsipy%20push%20tests/badge.svg\n    :target: https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/actions\n.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/sportsipy/badge/?version=latest\n    :target: https://sportsipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n    :alt: Documentation Status\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sportsipy.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.org/project/sportsipy\n\n.. contents::\n\nSportsipy is a free python API that pulls the stats from\nwww.sports-reference.com and allows them to be easily be used in python-based\napplications, especially ones involving data analytics and machine learning.\n\nSportsipy exposes a plethora of sports information from major sports\nleagues in North America, such as the MLB, NBA, College Football and Basketball,\nNFL, and NHL. Sportsipy also now supports Professional Football (or\nSoccer) for thousands of teams from leagues around the world. Every sport has\nits own set of valid API queries ranging from the list of teams in a league, to\nthe date and time of a game, to the total number of wins a team has secured\nduring the season, and many, many more metrics that paint a more detailed\npicture of how a team has performed during a game or throughout a season.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nThe easiest way to install `sportsipy` is by downloading the latest\nreleased binary from PyPI using PIP. For instructions on installing PIP, visit\n`PyPA.io <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_ for detailed steps on\ninstalling the package manager for your local environment.\n\nNext, run::\n\n    pip install sportsipy\n\nto download and install the latest official release of `sportsipy` on\nyour machine. You now have the latest stable version of `sportsipy`\ninstalled and can begin using it following the examples below!\n\nIf the bleeding-edge version of `sportsipy` is desired, clone this\nrepository using git and install all of the package requirements with PIP::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy\n    cd sportsipy\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nOnce complete, create a Python wheel for your default version of Python by\nrunning the following command::\n\n    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n\nThis will create a `.whl` file in the `dist` directory which can be installed\nwith the following command::\n\n    pip install dist/*.whl\n\nExamples\n========\n\nThe following are a few examples showcasing how easy it can be to collect\nan abundance of metrics and information from all of the tracked leagues. The\nexamples below are only a miniscule subset of the total number of statistics\nthat can be pulled using sportsipy. Visit the documentation on\n`Read The Docs <http://sportsipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for a\ncomplete list of all information exposed by the API.\n\nGet instances of all NHL teams for the 2018 season\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from sportsipy.nhl.teams import Teams\n\n    teams = Teams(2018)\n\nPrint every NBA team's name and abbreviation\n--------------------------------------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from sportsipy.nba.teams import Teams\n\n    teams = Teams()\n    for team in teams:\n        print(team.name, team.abbreviation)\n\nGet a specific NFL team's season information\n--------------------------------------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from sportsipy.nfl.teams import Teams\n\n    teams = Teams()\n    lions = teams('DET')\n\nPrint the date of every game for a NCAA Men's Basketball team\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from sportsipy.ncaab.schedule import Schedule\n\n    purdue_schedule = Schedule('purdue')\n    for game in purdue_schedule:\n        print(game.date)\n\nPrint the number of interceptions by the away team in a NCAA Football game\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from sportsipy.ncaaf.boxscore import Boxscore\n\n    championship_game = Boxscore('2018-01-08-georgia')\n    print(championship_game.away_interceptions)\n\nGet a Pandas DataFrame of all stats for a MLB game\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from sportsipy.mlb.boxscore import Boxscore\n\n    game = Boxscore('BOS201806070')\n    df = game.dataframe\n\nFind the number of goals a football team has scored\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from sportsipy.fb.team import Team\n\n    tottenham = Team('Tottenham Hotspur')\n    print(tottenham.goals_scored)\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nTwo blog posts detailing the creation and basic usage of `sportsipy` can\nbe found on The Medium at the following links:\n\n- `Part 1: Creating a public sports API <https://medium.com/clarktech-sports/python-sports-analytics-made-simple-part-1-14569d6e9a86>`_\n- `Part 2: Pull any sports metric in 10 lines of Python <https://medium.com/clarktech-sports/python-sports-analytics-made-simple-part-2-40e591a7f3db>`_\n\nThe second post in particular is a great guide for getting started with\n`sportsipy` and is highly recommended for anyone who is new to the\npackage.\n\nComplete documentation is hosted on\n`readthedocs.org <http://sportsipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_. Refer to\nthe documentation for a full list of all metrics and information exposed by\nsportsipy.

After all, it is a combination of two things I love. Almost three years ago, I wrote a post on my personal blog in which I tried\u200a\u2014\u200aat that time, still using YOLOv3\u200a\u2014\u200ato [detect and classify basketball players on the court](https://towardsdatascience.com/chess-rolls-or-basketball-lets-create-a-custom-object-detection-model-ef53028eac7d).\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022 has motivated me to revisit this idea. This time I used a combination of [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) and [ByteTrack](https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack) to track football players on the field. This blog post accompanies the Roboflow video where I talk through how to track players on a football field.\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26109316/207858600-ee862b22-0353-440b-ad85-caa0c4777904.mp4\n\n# \ud83e\udd38  3D Football Players Pose Estimation with YOLOv7\n\n[![YouTube](https://badges.aleen42.com/src/youtube.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWjKfjDGiYE)\n[![GitHub](https://badges.aleen42.com/src/github.svg)](https://github.com/SkalskiP/sport/tree/master/football-players-pose-estimation)\n\nI was watching a FIFA 2022 World Cup match the other day, and one of the things that caught my eye was VAR - Video Assistant Referee, or to be more precise, the part of it responsible for analyzing whether a player was on the offside. I did a little [research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WycjDx6giVE) and found that the system performs pose estimation on multiple cameras at once. I decided to check how difficult it would be to reproduce it at home using two cameras and [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7).\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26109316/207677038-20f951a6-e469-4b3f-a934-66e036fcff69.mp4\n"

With an inexpensive RTL-SDR device plugged into the Mac's USB port, LocalRadio provides a casual listening experience for your favorite local FM broadcasts, free music, news, sports, weather, public safety and aviation scanner monitoring, and other radio sources.  \n\nLocalRadio's easy-to-use web interface allows the radio to be shared from a Mac to iPhones, iPads, Android devices, and other PCs on your home network.  No additional software or hardware is required for sharing with mobile devices, simply use the built-in mobile web browser to connect to LocalRadio and tune to your favorite stations.  You can also listen to LocalRadio audio on your Apple TV and other AirPlay-compatible devices. Recent versions of LocalRadio have added an option for stereo listening of FM broadcasts and audio devices.\n\n\nLocalRadio is intended for use as in-home entertainment, using a local area network with a private IP address.  It has not been tested with a public IP address, particularly for security testing, therefore it is not recommended for that purpose.

The idea of this data is twofold: \n1. to allow potential clients to check out this data and get familiar with our formats and data quality. \n2. to provide some sample data to play around with to the broader football analytics community! \n\n## About the data\n- At the moment there are two games in our standard CSV format, in the coming days we will add the same data in the standar FIFA format. \n- The data of these two games is anonymized, meaning there are no references to the names of players, teams or competitions.\n- You'll see the data goes from 0 to 1 on each axis. The coordiante (0,0) is the top left, (1,1) is the bottom right, and (0.5,0.5) is the kick off point. \n- The dimensions of the field are the same for both games: 105x68 meters. \n- For the events, in the `documentation` folder you can find a pdf file with the definition and explanation of all our events types and subtypes. \n- Tracking and event data are synchronized.\n- [UPDATE 2021-04-15] A new game has been added: Sample Game 3. This game is in the new format (EPTS FIFA format for the tracking and metadata and json for the events). We recommend using [kloppy](https://github.com/PySport/kloppy/) to read this data.\n\n## Getting started\nLaurie Shaw (https://twitter.com/EightyFivePoint) form the Sports Analytics Lab of Harvard University has some great introductory python code to working with this data as part of the Friends of Tracking initiative. You can find it here: https://github.com/Friends-of-Tracking-Data-FoTD/LaurieOnTracking and watch his first lesson with this data here: https://youtu.be/8TrleFklEsE\n\n## Legal stuff\n- Please be responsible with the use of this data.\n- If you use it for anything public, please aknowledge the source.\n\n## Future plans\n- We will try to add data for more games in the future.\n- We will try to add (may be in another repo) scripts to get started analyzing this data.\n- To stay up to date with news and additions, follow https://twitter.com/brunodagnino\n\n## Other tracking data sources\n- 3 games from Hammarby by Signality as part of David Sumpter analytics course. Tracking and video (not synched), no events. https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/28112/pages/4-player-movements-on-the-pitch\n- 9 games by Skillcorner as part of the Friends of Tracking initiative. Tracking from broadcast feed, no events, no videos. https://github.com/SkillCorner/opendata\n- 19 goals scored by Livepool FC in 2019 by Lastrowview / Ricardo Tavares. Tracking (players and ball), no events, no vides. https://github.com/Friends-of-Tracking-Data-FoTD/Last-Row\n\n## Events data sources\n- Statsbomb open data: https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data\n- Wyscout event data: https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000\n\n"

Mais au besoin, les cotes disponibles sur ce site sont identiques \u00e0 celles disponibles sur [France Pari](https://www.france-pari.fr/)\n- [Genybet](https://sport.genybet.fr/) qui est davantage ax\u00e9 sur les paris hippiques plut\u00f4t que sportifs\n- [Vbet](https://www.vbet.fr/paris-sportifs) qui propose des promotions nombreuses mais tr\u00e8s restrictives et donc peu rentables\n\nLa r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration des cotes peut \u00eatre facilement utilis\u00e9e depuis l'interface sur l'onglet \"R\u00e9cup\u00e9ration des cotes\". Il suffit alors de choisir le sport, le (ou les) championnat(s) et le (ou les) bookmaker(s) souhait\u00e9s. Une barre de chargement appara\u00eet alors, la r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration des cotes est termin\u00e9e lorsque la barre dispara\u00eet.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82161583-5534cd80-989e-11ea-928d-c94c821cd873.png)\n\n\u00c0 titre informatif, toutes les cotes r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9es sont consultables depuis l'onglet \"Cotes\" de l'interface. Dans cet onglet vous pouvez ainsi facilement comparer les cotes d'un m\u00eame match entre les diff\u00e9rents bookmakers. Vous avez \u00e9galement la possibilit\u00e9 de supprimer un match que vous ne souhaitez pas prendre en compte dans les calculs futurs.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82209315-5e10b800-990d-11ea-9b5a-db1065d316eb.png)\n\n## Exemples d'utilisation\n\nLes bonus re\u00e7us sont quasi syst\u00e9matiquement des freebets (ou paris gratuits). Un tel bonus signifie que lorsque l'on mise, par exemple, sur une cote \u00e0 3 avec un freebet de 10\u20ac, si le pari s'av\u00e8re gagnant, alors on r\u00e9cup\u00e8re 3\u00d710-10 = 20\u20ac (contre 30\u20ac pour un pari standard), cela \u00e9quivaut donc \u00e0 miser avec un pari normal sur une cote r\u00e9duite de 1.\nOn verra plus tard qu'il est possible de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer de mani\u00e8re certaine, 80% de la valeur d'un freebet. Ainsi, un freebet de 10\u20ac \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 10 \u00d7 0.8 = 8\u20ac.\n\nLes exemples ci-dessous sont des exemples de promotions qui reviennent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement chez les diff\u00e9rents bookmakers. Vous y trouverez une description de comment exploiter au mieux ces promotions. Bien-s\u00fbr, cette liste n'est pas exhaustive et il vous appartient d'adapter ces exemples aux conditions des promotions que vous rencontrerez \u00e0 l'avenir.\nPour chacun des exemples, vous trouverez une explication de comment rentabiliser une promotion similaire en ligne de commande ou \u00e0 l'aide de l'interface.\n\n### Exemple 1 : Bonus re\u00e7u dans tous les cas si l'on mise sur un match donn\u00e9\nFrance-pari propose tr\u00e8s souvent une promotion qui consiste \u00e0 miser un pari de 20\u20ac sur un match pr\u00e9cis de Ligue 1 \u00e0 une cote minimale de 2 pour recevoir un freebet de 5\u20ac.\nPar exemple, pour la 20e journ\u00e9e de Ligue 1 2019/2020, le match propos\u00e9 \u00e9tait Toulouse - Brest.\nIl suffit alors d'ex\u00e9cuter:\n```python\n>>> parse_competition(\"ligue 1\", \"football\") #Si non ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment\n>>> best_stakes_match(\"Toulouse - Brest\", \"france_pari\", 20, 2, \"football\")\n```\nSi la plus-value minimum est sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 5 \u00d7 0.8 = 4\u20ac, alors cette promotion est rentable et on peut r\u00e9partir nos mises telles qu'elles sont d\u00e9crites.\n\nPour effectuer ce calcul depuis l'interface, il suffit de vous rendre sur l'onglet \"Pari sur un match donn\u00e9\" et de s\u00e9lectionner les param\u00e8tres souhait\u00e9s.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82214782-a1bbef80-9916-11ea-8c4e-62f8187a09b5.png)\n\n### Exemple 2 : Bonus re\u00e7u dans tous les cas si l'on mise sur un match quelconque, \u00e9ventuellement d'une comp\u00e9tition donn\u00e9e / d'un sport donn\u00e9\nS'il n'y a aucune condition sur le match \u00e0 jouer, on peut \u00e9x\u00e9cuter\n```python\n>>> parse_football()\n```\ncar, comme dit plus haut, ce sont ces matches qui vont g\u00e9n\u00e9rer le plus de rendement.\n\nSi on doit miser sur un match de NBA, on peut ex\u00e9cuter\n```python\n>>> parse_competition(\"nba\", \"basketball\")\n```\n\nSi on doit miser sur un match de tennis, on peut ex\u00e9cuter\n```python\n>>> parse_tennis()\n```\n\nOn notera par ailleurs qu'il n'est en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pas possible de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer les cotes de tous les matches d'un sport donn\u00e9, car cela peu \u00eatre tr\u00e8s couteux en temps d'ex\u00e9cution. Il faut donc choisir la ou les comp\u00e9tition(s) la (les) plus populaire(s) pour le sport choisi, car ce sont ces matches qui g\u00e9n\u00e8reront le plus de rendement.\nLe tableau ci-dessous indique quelle fonction appeler pour chaque sport.\n\n\n\n| Sport  | Fonction \u00e0 appeler |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| Football  | `parse_football()`  |\n| Basketball  | `parse_nba()` (raccourci de `parse_competition(\"nba\", \"basketball\")`)|\n| Tennis  | `parse_tennis()`  |\n| Rugby  | `parse_competitions([\"top 14\", \"champions cup\", \"six nations\"], \"rugby\")`  |\n| Hockey sur glace  | `parse_nhl()`  (raccourci de `parse_competition(\"nhl\", \"hockey-sur-glace\")`)  |\n\nUne fois votre ensemble de matches choisi, on peut alors utiliser la fonction `best_match_under_conditions`\n\nPar exemple, France-pari propose r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement une promotion qui consiste \u00e0 rembourser, en freebet, 10% des mises engag\u00e9es sur des cotes sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 1,70 et dans une limite de 100\u20ac rembours\u00e9s. L'objectif est alors de miser 1000\u20ac afin de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer le bonus maximal. Ainsi, si l'on suppose que la promotion se d\u00e9roule entre le 3 janvier 2020 \u00e0 minuit et le 12 janvier 2020 \u00e0 23h59, on peut ex\u00e9cuter :\n```python\n>>> best_match_under_conditions(\"france_pari\", 1.7, 1000, \"football\", \"3/1/2020\", \"0h00\", \"12/1/2020\", \"23h59\")\n```\nSi la perte affich\u00e9e est inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 100 \u00d7 0.8 = 80\u20ac, alors cette promotion est rentable et on peut r\u00e9partir nos mises telles qu'elles sont d\u00e9crites.\n\nDepuis l'interface, cela revient \u00e0 se rendre sur l'onglet \"Pari simple\" et rentrer les param\u00e8tres ad\u00e9quats.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82214951-e21b6d80-9916-11ea-8c95-2c3daf1a5b03.png)\n\n\n### Exemple 3 : Bonus re\u00e7u si au moins *n* matches gagn\u00e9s\n*Nota bene*: \u00c0 partir de cet exemple, on supposera que l'on a pr\u00e9alablement appel\u00e9 une fonction d'initialisation des matches voulus (du type `parse_...`), en fonction des besoins de la promotion.\n\nParfois, il est n\u00e9cessaire de gagner un certain nombre de paris pour recevoir un bonus. Dans ces cas-l\u00e0, il faut miser sur le m\u00eame bookmaker sur chacune des issues d'un m\u00eame match. Betclic propose par exemple parfois de recevoir 10\u20ac de freebet pour 3 paris gagn\u00e9s, de 5\u20ac chacun, mis\u00e9s sur des cotes d'au moins 1.7 et plac\u00e9s sur 3 matches diff\u00e9rents. On peut alors ex\u00e9cuter\n```python\n>>> best_match_pari_gagnant(\"betclic\", 1.7, 5, \"tennis\")\n```\nCette fonction donnera le meilleur match sur lequel parier \u00e0 un instant donn\u00e9. Si la perte affich\u00e9e est inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 (10 \u00d7 0.8)/3, alors on peut supposer que cette promotion est rentable et on peut r\u00e9partir nos mises telles qu'elles sont d\u00e9crites. Cela constituera le premier pari gagnant. Un peu plus tard (par exemple lorsque le match en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 jou\u00e9), on peut r\u00e9it\u00e9rer ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9 afin de savoir sur quel match doit on jouer pour gagner le 2\u00e8me pari de la s\u00e9rie et ainsi de suite jusqu'\u00e0 atteindre 3 paris gagnants. \u00c0 noter, que dans ce cas pr\u00e9cis, il est n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9-ex\u00e9cuter la fonction `parse_tennis` une fois qu'on a gagn\u00e9 un pari, car dans le cas contraire, le r\u00e9sultat renvoy\u00e9 par la fonction `best_match_pari_gagnant` serait identique au r\u00e9sultat de l'ex\u00e9cution pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente.\n\nDepuis l'interface, il vous suffit de vous rendre sur l'onglet \"Pari gagnant\" et de rentrer les param\u00e8tres voulus.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82216530-5a832e00-9919-11ea-9e62-5e0eeb10fe3d.png)\n\nUne fois le pari plac\u00e9, vous avez la possibilit\u00e9 de supprimer le match obtenu de la base de donn\u00e9es depuis l'onglet \"Cotes\".\nDe cette mani\u00e8re, vous obtienez un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent lorsque vous r\u00e9ex\u00e9cutez le calcul depuis l'onglet \"Pari gagnant\".\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82234278-7bf01400-9931-11ea-836b-e0a53a31deb6.png)\n\n\n### Exemple 4 : Bonus re\u00e7u si un pari est perdant.\nIl s'agit d'un type de promotion tr\u00e8s courant, notamment en ce qui concerne les offres de bienvenue, mais pas seulement.\nPar exemple, \u00e0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2018, Winamax proposait \u00e0 ses utilisateurs de rembourser en cash (donc pas en freebet) 100% leur premier pari de 200\u20ac maximum si celui-ci est perdant. On notera par ailleurs que sur Winamax (comme sur la plupart des autres bookmakers), on ne peut parier que sur des cotes sup\u00e9rieures (ou \u00e9gales) \u00e0 1.10. On peut alors ex\u00e9cuter\n```python\n>>> best_match_cashback(\"winamax\", 1.1, 200, \"football\", freebet=False)\n```\n\nCe calcul est \u00e9galement accessible depuis l'interface, dans l'onglet \"Cashback\".\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82234484-c6719080-9931-11ea-8357-191bd9f58a78.png)\n\n\n## Conversion des freebets en cash\n### M\u00e9thode 1 : Si l'on n'a que des freebets fractionnables\nChez les bookmakers suivant : Betclic, Unibet, ParionsSport et Zebet, il est possible de fractionner les freebets gagn\u00e9s en plusieurs paris. Par exemple, si l'on a gagn\u00e9 10\u20ac de freebets, il est possible de miser 8\u20ac puis 2\u20ac.\nPour optimiser le gain, l'id\u00e9e va alors \u00eatre de couvrir toutes les issues avec des freebets sur un combin\u00e9 de 2 matches de football (ce qui repr\u00e9sente donc 9 issues \u00e0 couvrir).\nPar exemple, si on dispose de 10\u20ac de freebet, on va alors ex\u00e9cuter\n```python\n>>> best_matches_freebet_one_site(\"betclic\", 10)\n```\n\n\n\n### M\u00e9thode 2 : Si l'on a quelques freebets non fractionnables et suffisamment de freebets fractionnables\nChez tous les bookmakers sauf Betclic, Unibet, ParionsSport et Zebet, il n'est pas possible de s\u00e9parer un freebet en plusieurs paris. \nSupposons que l'on dispose de 100\u20ac de freebets fractionnables sur Betclic, 1 freebet de 10\u20ac sur Winamax et 2 freebets de 5\u20ac sur France-pari. \nL'id\u00e9e serait alors de r\u00e9partir nos 100\u20ac de freebets fractionnables sur un combin\u00e9 de 2 matches comme dans la m\u00e9thode 1, puis de remplacer (totalement ou en partie) certaines mises par des freebets non fractionnables des autres bookmakers. De cette mani\u00e8re on r\u00e9partit les freebets non fractionnables sur plusieurs issues d'un combin\u00e9 et on comble les diff\u00e9rences avec des freebets fractionnables. On aura donc vraisemblablement des issues couvertes uniquement par un freebet non fractionnable, d'autres couvertes en partie par un freebet non fractionnable et un freebet fractionnable, et d'autres couvertes uniquement en freebet fractionnable. Dans cet exemple, on ex\u00e9cute alors\n```python\n>>> best_matches_freebet([\"betclic\"], [[10, \"winamax\"], [5, \"france_pari\"], [5, \"france_pari\"]])\n```\n\nDepuis l'interface, l'onglet \"Freebets \u00e0 placer\" effectue le m\u00eame calcul, on obtient alors:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82235094-924a9f80-9932-11ea-95d9-e6c49d25fc00.png)\n\n\nCette deuxi\u00e8me m\u00e9thode doit, lorsqu'elle est possible, \u00eatre celle \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier lorsque l'on dispose de freebets non fractionnables car c'est elle qui offre le meilleur rendement. La premi\u00e8re m\u00e9thode est elle aussi tr\u00e8s rentable mais il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de conserver les freebets fractionnables pour justement appliquer la 2e m\u00e9thode lorsque l'on disposera de freebets non fractionnables.\n\n\n\n### M\u00e9thode 3 : Si l'on dispose de freebets non fractionnables et pas assez de freebets fractionnables\nPar ailleurs, chez tous les bookmakers sauf Betclic, Unibet et Zebet, les freebets ont une date limite d'utilisation, allant de 2-3 jours pour Bwin, \u00e0 1 mois pour France-pari. Il peut donc \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire de les jouer rapidement et il se peut \u00e9galement que l'on n'ait pas assez de freebets fractionnables pour pouvoir appliquer la 2e m\u00e9thode. Dans cette situation, il est plus efficace de parier sur un unique match plut\u00f4t que sur un combin\u00e9. Il est \u00e9galement n\u00e9cessaire de couvrir un pari en freebet avec de l'argent r\u00e9el. De plus, avec cette m\u00e9thode, on ne peut jouer qu'un freebet \u00e0 la fois. Ainsi si l'on dispose d'un freebet de 15\u20ac chez Betstars, on ex\u00e9cute alors\n```python\n>>> best_match_freebet(\"betstars\", 15, \"football\")\n```\n*Nota bene* : Ne pas confondre `best_match_freebet` et `best_matches_freebet`.\n\nOn notera par ailleurs que certains sites comme NetBet ou PMU proposent parfois des freebets qui ne sont jouables que sur un unique sport. Auquel cas, il faut adapter le sport \u00e0 la situation.\n\n\nOn peut appliquer cette m\u00e9thode depuis l'interface dans l'onglet \"Freebet unique\".\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82234834-3122cc00-9932-11ea-8709-6dec63176058.png)\n\n\n\nCette m\u00e9thode est en moyenne beaucoup moins rentable et beaucoup plus volatile que les deux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Les deux premi\u00e8res m\u00e9thodes assurent un taux de revient situ\u00e9 entre 77 et 85% de la somme de freebets engag\u00e9s. Avec la 3\u00e8me m\u00e9thode, il faut s'attendre \u00e0 un taux de revient situ\u00e9 entre 55 et 70%.\n\n\n## Avertissement\nCe projet a pour but d'aider l'utilisateur \u00e0 d\u00e9gager de l'argent en se rapprochant au maximum de l'absence de risque.

For example, if you only want to focus on French Ligue 1 matches, and you only want to bet on Betclic and Winamax, you would write :\n```python\n>>> parse_competition(\"ligue 1 france\", \"football\", \"betclic\", \"winamax\")\n```\nNote that if you do not specify a bookmaker, the algorithm will retrieve the odds of the matches of the competition from most of the bookmakers approved by the ARJEL (French Regulatory authority for online games).\nIf you do not have a specific competition or target sport, it is advisable to call\n```python\n>>> parse_football()\n```\nor, for example,\n```python\n>>> parse_football(\"betclic\", \"winamax\")\n```\nThese functions will retrieve the odds of the matches available at the various bookmakers for the 5 major European football championships (Ligue 1, Premier League, LaLiga, Serie A, Bundesliga), as these competitions generally generate the highest returns.\nIt should be pointed out that in the case of tennis where there is no fixed competition, it is necessary to call the function:\n```python\n>>> parse_tennis()\n```\nor, for example,\n```python\n>>> parse_tennis(\"betclic\", \"winamax\")\n```\nThis command will retrieve the odds of tennis matches from the competitions currently being played.\n\nYou will find below a summary table of the different French bookmakers with the associated string in the package.\n\n| Bookmaker | String |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| [Betclic](https://www.betclic.fr/sport/) | ``\"betclic\"\" |\n| [BetStars](https://www.betstars.fr/) | ``betstars\"` |\n| [Bwin](https://sports.bwin.fr/fr/sports) | \"bwin\" |\n| [France Pari](https://www.france-pari.fr/) | `\"france_pari\"` |\n| [JOA](https://www.joa-online.fr/fr/sport) | \"joa\"` |\n| [NetBet](https://www.netbet.fr/) | `\"netbet\"` |\n| [Pariels Sport](https://www.enligne.parionssport.fdj.fr/) |\n| [PasinoBet](https://www.pasinobet.fr/) ||\"pasinobet\"` |\n| [PMU](https://paris-sportifs.pmu.fr/) |\"pmu\"` |\n| [Unibet](https://www.unibet.fr/sport) |\n| [Winamax](https://www.winamax.fr/paris-sportifs/sports/) |\n| [Zebet](https://www.zebet.fr/fr/) |\n\n*Note bene*: It is currently not possible to use the package for the following bookmakers:\n- [Feelingbet](https://feelingbet.fr/) which offers very few promotions. But if necessary, the odds available on this site are identical to those available on [France Pari](https://www.france-pari.fr/).\n- [Genybet](https://sport.genybet.fr/) which focuses more on horse betting rather than sports betting.\n- Vbet](https://www.vbet.fr/paris-sportifs) which offers numerous but very restrictive and therefore unprofitable promotions.\n\n\n## Examples of use\n\nThe bonuses received are almost always freebets (or paris gratuits). Such a bonus means that when you bet, for example, on an odds equals to 3 with a \u20ac10 freebet, if the bet turns out to be winning, then you get 3\u00d710-10 = \u20ac20 (compared to \u20ac30 for a standard bet), so it is equivalent to betting with a normal bet on an odds reduced by 1.\nWe will see later that it is possible to win back 80% of the value of a freebet with certainty. Thus, a \u20ac10 freebet is equivalent to 10 \u00d7 0.8 = \u20ac8.\n\nThe examples below are examples of promotions that regularly appear at the different bookmakers. You will find a description of how to get the most out of these promotions. This list is naturally not exhaustive and it is up to you to adapt these examples to the conditions of the promotions you will encounter in the future.\n### Example 1: Bonus received in all cases if you bet on a given match\nFrance-pari very often offers a promotion which consists in betting a \u20ac20 bet on a specific Ligue 1 match at a minimum odds of 2 to receive a \u20ac5 freebet.\nFor example, for the 20th round of Ligue 1 2019/2020, the proposed match was Dijon - Metz.\nYou just have to execute:\n```python\n>>> parse_competition(\"ligue 1\", \"football\") #If not previously executed\n>>> best_stakes_match(\"Dijon - Metz\", \"france_pari\", 20, 2, \"football\")\n```\nIf the minimum raise is more than 5 \u00d7 0.8 = \u20ac4, then this promotion is profitable and we can split our bets as specified.\n\n\n### Example 2: Bonus received in all cases if you bet on any match, possibly from a given competition / sport\nIf there are no conditions on the game to be played, we can execute\n```python\n>>> parse_football()\n```\nbecause, as mentioned above, it is these matches that will generate the most returns.\n\nIf we're betting on an NBA game, we can execute...\n```python\n>>> parse_competition(\"nba\", \"basketball\")\n```\n\nIf we're going to bet on a tennis match, we can execute\n```python\n>>> parse_tennis()\n```\n\nIt should also be noted that it is generally not possible to retrieve the odds of all the matches of a given sport, as this can be very costly in terms of execution time. It is therefore necessary to choose the most popular competition(s) for the chosen sport, as it is these matches that will generate the most returns.\nThe table below indicates which function to call for each sport.\n\n\n\n| Sport | Function to call |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| Football | `parse_football()` |\n| Basketball | `parse_nba()` (short for `parse_competition(\"nba\", \"basketball\")`)|\n| Tennis | `parse_tennis()` |\n| Rugby | `parse_competitions([\"top 14\", \"champions cup\", \"six nations\"], \"rugby\")` |\n| Ice Hockey | `parse_nhl()` (short for `parse_competition(\"nhl\", \"hockey-sur-glace\")`) |\n\nOnce you have chosen your set of matches, you can then use the `best_match_under_conditions` function.\n\nFor example, France-pari regularly offers a promotion which consists in reimbursing, in freebet, 10% of the stakes engaged on odds higher than 1.70 and within a limit of \u20ac100 reimbursed. The objective is then to bet \u20ac1000 in order to recover the maximum bonus. Thus, if we assume that the promotion takes place between January 3, 2020 at midnight and January 12, 2020 at 11:59 pm, we can execute :\n```python\n>>> best_match_under_conditions(\"france_pari\", 1.7, 1000, \"football\", \"3/1/2020\", \"0h00\", \"12/1/2020\", \"23h59\")\n```\nIf the displayed loss is less than 100 \u00d7 0.8 = \u20ac80, then this promotion is profitable and we can distribute our stakes as described.\n\n### Example 3: Bonus received if at least *n* matches are won\nPlease note: From this example, we'll assume that we previously called a function to initialize the desired matches (of the type `parse_...`), according to the needs of the promotion.\n\nSometimes it is necessary to win a certain number of bets to receive a bonus. In these cases, it is necessary to bet on the same bookmaker on each of the outcomes of the same match. For example, Betclic sometimes offers to receive a \u20ac10 freebet for 3 bets won, of \u20ac5 each, bet on odds of at least 1.7 and placed on 3 different matches. You can then execute\n```python\n>>> best_match_pari_gagnant(\"betclic\", 1.7, 5, \"tennis\")\n```\nThis feature will give you the best match to bet on at any given time. If the displayed loss is less than (10 \u00d7 0.8)/3, then we can assume that this promotion is profitable and we can distribute our stakes as described. This will be the first winning bet. A little later (e.g. when the match in question has been played), we can repeat this procedure to find out which match we need to play to win the 2nd bet in the series and so on until we reach 3 winning bets. Note that in this case, it is necessary to re-execute the `parse_tennis` function once you have won a bet, because otherwise the result returned by the `best_match_pari_gagnant` function would be identical to the result of the previous execution.\n\n### Example 4: Bonus received if a bet is lost.\nThis is a very common type of promotion, especially but not only for welcome offers.\nFor example, in the summer of 2018, Winamax offered its users to pay back in cash (not freebet) 100% of their first bet of \u20ac200 maximum if they lost. It should also be noted that on Winamax (as on most other bookmakers), you can only bet on odds greater than (or equal to) 1.10. You can then run\n```python\n>>> best_match_cashback(\"winamax\", 1.1, 200, \"football\", freebet=False)\n```\n\n## Converting freebets to cash\n### Method 1: If you only have fractionable freebets\nAt the following bookmakers: Betclic, Unibet, ParionsSport and Zebet, it is possible to split the won freebets into several bets. For example, if you have won \u20ac10 in freebets, you can bet \u20ac8 and then \u20ac2.\nTo optimize the win, the idea will be to cover all the outcomes with freebets on a combination of 2 football matches (which represents 9 outcomes to cover).\nFor example, if you have \u20ac10 of freebet, you will then run\n```python\n>>> best_matches_freebet_one_site(\"betclic\", 10)\n```\n\n### Method 2: If you have a few non-fractionable freebets and enough fractionable freebets\nAt all bookmakers except Betclic, Unibet, ParionsSport and Zebet, it is not possible to split a freebet into several bets. \nLet's suppose that you have \u20ac100 fractionable freebets on Betclic, 1 freebet of \u20ac10 on Winamax and 2 freebets of \u20ac5 on France-pari. \nThe idea would then be to spread our \u20ac100 of fractionable freebets over a combination of 2 games as in method 1, then replace (totally or partially) some stakes with non-fractionable freebets from other bookmakers. In this way we spread the non-fractionable freebets over several outcomes of a handset and compensate the differences with fractionable freebets. So you are likely to have some outcomes covered only by a non-fractionable freebet, others covered partly by a non-fractionable freebet and a fractionable freebet, and others covered only by a fractionable freebet. In this example, we then execute\n```python\n>>> best_matches_freebet([\"betclic\"], [[10, \"winamax\"], [5, \"france_pari\"], [5, \"france_pari\"])\n```\nThis second method should, where possible, be the preferred method when non-fractionable freebets are available, as it offers the best return. The first method is also very profitable but it is preferable to keep the fractionable freebets in order to apply the second method when you have non-fractionable freebets.\n\n### Method 3: If you have non-fractionable freebets and not enough fractionable freebets\nAt all bookmakers except Betclic, Unibet and Zebet, freebets have a time limit, ranging from 2-3 days for Bwin, to 1 month for France-pari. It may therefore be necessary to bet them quickly and there may not be enough fractionable freebets to be able to apply the 2nd method. In this situation, it is more efficient to bet on a single match rather than on a combination. It is also necessary to cover a freebet with real money. Furthermore, with this method, you can only play one freebet at a time. So if you have a \u20ac15 freebet at Betstars, then you can execute\n```python\n>>> best_match_freebet(\"betstars\", 15, \"football\")\n```\nPlease note: Be careful not to confuse `best_match_freebet` with `best_matches_freebet`.\n\nNote that some sites like NetBet or PMU sometimes offer freebets that are only playable on a single sport. In this case, you have to adapt the sport to the situation.\nThis method is on average much less profitable and much more volatile than the first two. The first two methods ensure a return rate of between 77 and 85% of the sum of freebets placed.  With the third method, a return rate between 55 and 70% is to be expected.\n\n\n## Disclaimer\nThis project aims to help the user to free up money by getting as close as possible to the absence of risk.

Please\nsee [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details.**\n\n## Development Info\n\nIf you just want to play the game, go to <https://zengm.com/>. Instructions\nbelow are for developers who want to run a copy locally so they can make changes\nto the code.\n\nIf you want to contribute but get stuck somewhere, please contact me! I'm happy\nto help.\n\n### License and Contributor License Agreement\n\n**This project is NOT open source, but it is also not completely closed. Please\nsee LICENSE.md for details.**\n\nIf you want to contribute code to this project, you must sign a contributor\nlicense agreement. There are separate forms for individuals and entities (such\nas corporations):\n\n* [Individual CLA](CLA-individual.md) (this is probably what you want)\n* [Entity CLA](CLA-entity.md)\n\nMake a copy of the form, fill in your information at the bottom, and send an\nemail to jeremy@zengm.com with the subject line, \"Contributor License Agreement\nfrom YOUR_NAME_HERE (GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE)\".\n\n### Step 1 - Installing\n\nMake sure you're using a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), older\nversions probably won't work. Then, all of the tooling used in development can\nbe set up by simply installing [Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) and\nrunning:\n\n    yarn install\n\nfrom within this folder.\n\n### Step 2 - Building\n\nTo build the app along with all its assets, run\n\n    yarn run build\n\nHowever during development, you probably would rather do\n\n    yarn run start-watch\n\nwhich will start the server and watch JS and CSS files for changes and\nrecompile. This simply runs both `yarn run start` and `yarn run watch` together,\nwhich alternatively can be run separately if you wish.\n\nBy default this will build the basketball version of the game. For other sports,\nset the SPORT environment variable to \"football\", \"baseball\", or \"hockey\", like:\n\n    SPORT=football yarn run start-watch\n\nOpen `package.json` to see all available development scripts.\n\n### Step 3 - Running\n\nTo run the game locally, you need some way of running a web server to display\nthe content. There are currently two ways to do it. It doesn't matter which you\nuse as long as you can get it to run on your computer.\n\n#### 1. Node.js (easiest)\n\nRun\n\n    yarn run start\n\nand point your browser to <http://localhost:3000/>. If you use the command `yarn\nrun start-watch` from above, then running the command `yarn run start` is not\nnecessary.\n\n#### 2. Apache\n\nThe mod_rewrite rules in `.htaccess` let the game run in Apache. Everything\nshould work if you point it at the `build` folder with mod_rewrite enabled.\n\n### Step 4 - Testing\n\nTypeScript and ESLint are used to enforce some coding standards. To run them on\nthe entire codebase, run\n\n    yarn run lint\n\nIntegration and unit tests spread out through the codebase in *.test.ts files.\nCoverage is not great. They can be run from the command line with\n\n    yarn test\n\nThere is also a single end-to-end test which creates a league and simulates a\nseason. To execute the end-to-end test, run\n\n    yarn run test-e2e\n\nFor the end-to-end test, by default it is basketball. If you want it to do\nfootball, stick `SPORT=football ` in front.\n\n### Code Overview\n\nThis is a single-page app that runs almost entirely client-side by storing data\nin IndexedDB. The core of the game runs inside a Shared Worker (or a Web Worker\nin crappy browsers that don't support Shared Workers), and then each open tab\nruns only UI code that talks to the worker. The UI code is in the `src/ui`\nfolder and the core game code is in the `src/worker` folder. They communicate\nthrough the `toUI` and `toWorker` functions.\n\nThe UI is built with React and Bootstrap.\n\nIn the worker, data is ultimately stored in IndexedDB, but for performance and\ncross-browser compatibility reasons, a cache (implemented in\n`src/worker/db/Cache.ts`) sits on top of the database containing all commonly\naccessed data. The idea is that IndexedDB should only be accessed for uncommon\nsituations, like viewing stats from past seasons. For simulating games and\nviewing current data, only the cache should be necessary.\n\nThe cache is overly complicated because (1) the values it returns are mutable,\nso you better not mess with them accidentally, and (2) when you do purposely\nmutate a value (like updating a player's stats), you need to remember to always\nwrite it back to the cache manually by calling `idb.cache.*.put`.\n\nIn both the worker and UI processes, there is a global variable `self.bbgm`\nwhich gives you access to many of the internal functions of the game from\nwithin your browser.\n\n### Shared Worker Debugging\n\nAs mentioned above, the core of a game runs in a Shared Worker. This makes\ndebugging a little tricky. For instance, in Chrome, if you `console.log`\nsomething inside the Shared Worker, you won't see it in the normal JS console.\nInstead, you need to go to chrome://inspect/#workers and click \"Inspect\" under\n<http://localhost/gen/worker.js>.\n\nIn any browser, if you have two tabs open and you reload one of them, the worker\nprocess will not reload. So make sure you close all tabs except one before\nreloading if you want to see changes in the worker.\n\n### Service Worker\n\nThis only applies if you use Apache, not if you use `yarn run start`!\n\nA service worker is used for offline caching. This can make development tricky,\nbecause if you load the game in your browser, make a change, wait for\nbuild/watch to finish, and then reload... you will not see your change because\nit will cache the original version and then not update it on a reload. This is\nthe normal behavior for service workers (they only switch to a new version when\nyou actually close the website and reopen it, not on a reload), but it makes\ndevelopment annoying.\n\nTo work around that, in Chrome you can [use the \"Update on reload\" option][1]\nand keep your devtools open. Then reloading will always get you the latest\nversion.\n\nEven with that, ctrl+shift+r may be a good idea to make sure you're seeing your\nlatest changes.\n\n[1]: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/lifecycle#update_on_reload\n\n### Git Workflow\n\nIf you want to contribute changes back to the project, first create a fork on\nGitHub. Then make your changes in a new branch. Confirm that the tests\n(hopefully including new ones you wrote!) and ESLint all pass. Finally, send me\na pull request.\n\nIt's also probably a good idea to create an [issue on\nGitHub](https://github.com/zengm-games/zengm/issues) before you start working\non something to keep me in the loop.\n\n## Less Important Development Info\n\n### Sport-specific stuff\n\nAbbreviations of stats should be done like basketball-reference.com and\nfootball-reference.com stat pages. For instance, \"defensive rebounds\" is \"drb\".\n\n### Thank you BrowserStack\n\nShout out to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for helping with\ncross-browser testing.\n"

Currently, this method is only \nsupported on Windows operating systems.\n\n### Installation Procedure\n#### Step 1 - Install Python\nOnly required if you don't have a (suitable) python installation on your system.\n- Download the latest Python version for your operating system from the [`Python website`](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n- Run the Python installer (Windows) or follow the instructions for your operating system. \n\n#### Step 2 - Download and Extract Hitrava\n- Go to the [Releases page][latest release] to download the source code of the latest Hitrava release.\n- On the [Releases page][latest release], in the _Assets_ section, click on the _Source code (zip)_ link to download \n  the sources.\n- Save the ZIP file with the sources on your system.\n- Extract all contents of the ZIP file with the sources to a location of your choice on your system.\n\n#### Step 3 - Download and Extract Stand-alone 7-Zip\nNOTE: This step is required to convert **encrypted** Huawei Health ZIP files.\n\n- Download the latest 7-zip **stand-alone** console version from the [`7-Zip website`](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).\nThe stand-alone version can be identified by the description below:\n> 7-Zip Extra: standalone console version, 7z DLL, Plugin for Far Manager\n- Extract the file _7za.exe_ from the downloaded archive and place it in your Hitrava installation folder from step 2 \nabove. Your Hitrava installation folder should now contain at least the following files.\n> Hitrava.py  \n> 7za.exe  \n> Run_Hitrava_Decrypt.cmd\n\n## How to convert your health activities and import them in Strava\nAll users can use conversion from a **[ZIP](#Windows-Users---Encrypted-ZIP-conversion-procedure)** file or a **[JSON](#JSON-file-conversion-example)** file.  \nFor users with rooted phones, legacy **[file](#single-file-conversion-examples)** and \n**[tar](#tar-file-conversion-examples)** options are still available.\n\n### Windows Users - Encrypted ZIP conversion procedure\nNOTE: As of late October 2020, the latest version of the Huawei Health app obliges you to provide a password with which \nyour data in the ZIP file will be encrypted. If you need to convert from an older non-encrypted ZIP file, please refer \nto the **[corresponding example](#zip-file-conversion-example)**.\n \nActivities can be mass converted using the data in a ZIP file that you can request in the Huawei Health app.\n\nThe procedure below assumes that you [installed Hitrava](#installation) and are logged in with your Huawei account in\nthe Huawei Health app. If you don't have a Huawei account, you can create one in the app.  \n\n#### Step 1 - Request your data in the Huawei Health app\n- On your phone, open the Huawei Health app.\n- Tap the **'Me'** button in the lower right-hand corner of the main screen.\n- Now tap on your account name on top of the screen.\n- Tap on **'Privacy Center'**. \n- Tap **'Request Your Data'**. \n- Select **'Health'** from the list and confirm your selection.\n- You will be obligated to enter a password to encrypt the requested data with. You will need this password later in\nstep 3 below.   \n- Follow any further in-app instructions.\n- Wait for the mail from Huawei to arrive with a link to download the data (ZIP file). \n\n#### Step 2 - Download your requested data\n- In the mail from Huawei, click on the link to download your data and follow the instructions.\n- Put (a copy of) the downloaded ZIP file in the Hitrava installation folder and rename it to _HiZip.zip_. \n\n#### Step 3 - Convert the data with Hitrava\n\n>**Tip**: If you're on Windows, and you're not familiar with the Command Prompt or just want to do a quick\n> conversion with default arguments, you can use the _Run_Hitrava_Decrypt.cmd_ batch file.\n>- Open the _Run_Hitrava_Decrypt.cmd_ file with a text editor and change the password 123456 to the password you \n>provided in step 2 above. \n>- double-click the _Run_Hitrava_Decrypt.cmd_ file in the installation folder of Hitrava.  \n> This will convert all available activities in the ZIP file from the previous step.                                                                                                                   \n\n- Open a Command Prompt and change the directory to the installation folder of Hitrava.\n- In the Command Prompt, run Hitrava.py with the --zip command line argument. You can start from the default example \ncommand below or [add / change command line arguments](#command-line-arguments-overview) as you need.  \n\n**IMPORTANT**: You must replace the password 123456 with the password you provided in step 2 above.\n  ```\n  Hitrava.py --zip HiZip.zip --password 123456 --json_export\n  ```\n  The above command will generate both the original HiTrack files and the converted TCX files for ALL activities to the\n  _output_ subfolder of the Hitrava installation folder. In this folder:\n  - Files without an extension are the Huawei HiTrack files which contain the raw unconverted data of an activity. \n  - Files with the _.json_ extension represent an exported copy of the JSON data of a single activity. \n  - Files with the **_.tcx_** extension are the **converted files** suitable for upload to Strava.\n\n#### Step 4 - Upload your data to Strava\nYou can now go to the Strava website to import your data.\n- Go to the **[`'Upload and Sync Your Activities'`](https://www.strava.com/upload/select)** page on Strava. \n- Log in with your Strava account. \n- Once logged in, use the **'Browse...'** button on the page and select the converted TCX files (with the _.tcx_ \nextension, up to 25 at once) to upload. \n\n### Other Operating Systems Users (macOS, Linux, UNIX)\n#### Step 1 - Request your data\nFollow the same procedure as for Windows users explained [above](#step-1---request-your-data-in-the-huawei-health-app).\n\n#### Step 2 - Download and extract your data\n- In the mail from Huawei, click on the link to download your data and follow the instructions.\n- Extract the following file from the downloaded ZIP file using an unzip tool for your operating system that supports\n AES encrypted ZIP files.\n  > Motion path detail data & description/motion path detail data.json\n- Put (a copy of) the extracted file in the Hitrava installation folder and rename it to HiJson.json.\n\n#### Step 3 - Convert the JSON file with Hitrava\n- Open a Terminal window and change the directory to the installation folder of Hitrava.\n- In the terminal Prompt, run Hitrava.py with the --json command line argument. You can start from the default example\n  command below or [add / change command line arguments](#command-line-arguments-overview) as you need.\n  ```\n  python3 Hitrava.py --json HiJson.json --json_export\n  ```\n  The above command will generate both the original HiTrack files and the converted TCX files for ALL activities to the\n  _output_ subfolder of the Hitrava installation folder. In this folder:\n  - Files without an extension are the Huawei HiTrack files which contain the raw unconverted data of an activity.\n  - Files with the _.json_ extension represent an exported copy of the JSON data of a single activity.\n  - Files with the **_.tcx_** extension are the **converted files** suitable for upload to Strava.\n\n#### Step 4 - Upload your data\nFollow the same procedure as for Windows users explained [above](#step-4---upload-your-data-to-strava).\n\n## Usage\n### Command Line Arguments Overview\n```\nusage: Hitrava.py [-h] [-z ZIP] [-p PASSWORD] [-j JSON] [--json_export] [-f FILE]\n                  [-s {Walk,Run,Cycle,Swim_Pool,Swim_Open_Water}] [-t TAR]\n                  [--from_date FROM_DATE] [--pool_length POOL_LENGTH]\n                  [--tcx_insert_altitude_data] [--output_dir OUTPUT_DIR]\n                  [--use_original_filename]\n                  [--output_file_prefix OUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX]\n                  [--suppress_output_file_sequence] [--validate_xml]\n                  [--log_level {INFO,DEBUG}]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --log_level {INFO,DEBUG}\n                        Set the logging level.\n\nJSON options:\n  -z ZIP, --zip ZIP     The filename of the Huawei Cloud ZIP file containing\n                        the JSON file with the motion path detail data to\n                        convert.

Note that the available\n                        speed data has a minimum resolution of 1 dm/s.\n\nTCX options:\n  --tcx_insert_altitude_data\n                        When an activity has altitude information, inserts the\n                        last known altitude in every track point of the\n                        generated TCX file.\n  --tcx_use_raw_distance_data\n                        In JSON or ZIP mode, when using this option the\n                        converted TCX files will use the raw distance data as\n                        calculated from the raw HiTrack data. When not\n                        specified (default), all distances in the TCX files\n                        will be normalized to match the original Huawei\n                        distance.\n\nOUTPUT options:\n  --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR\n                        The path to the directory to store the output files.\n                        The default directory is ./output.\n  --use_original_filename\n                        In single FILE or TAR mode, when using this option the\n                        converted TCX files will have the same filename as the\n                        original input file (except from the file extension).\n  --output_file_prefix OUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX\n                        Adds the strftime representation of this argument as a\n                        prefix to the generated TCX XML file(s). E.g. use\n                        %Y-%m-%d- to add human readable year-month-day\n                        information in the name of the generated TCX file.\n  --suppress_output_file_sequence\n                        Suppresses the sequence number suffix in the filenames\n                        of converted TCX files when converting activities in\n                        ZIP or JSON mode.\n  --validate_xml        Validate generated TCX XML file(s). NOTE: requires\n                        xmlschema library and an internet connection to\n                        retrieve the TCX XSD.\n```\n                        \n### Usage Examples\n#### Encrypted ZIP file conversion example\nUse the command below to convert all activities available in the **encrypted** ZIP file with the Huawei \nPrivacy data (here with filename _HiZip.zip_) that were started on October, 3rd, 2019 or later.  \nThe ZIP file was encrypted with password 123456 provided in the Huawei Health app.  \nThe following files will be generated in folder _./my_output_dir_:  \n- JSON files with the raw JSON data of a single activity (_.json_ file extension).\n- HiTrack files with the unconverted source data of a single activity (no extension, filenames start with _HiTrack__).\n- Converted TCX files for upload to Strava (_.tcx_ file extension).\n \n```\n python Hitrava.py --zip HiZip.zip --password 123456 --json_export --from_date 2019-10-03 --output_dir my_output_dir\n```\n\n#### ZIP file conversion example\nUse the command below to convert all activities available in the ZIP file with the Huawei \nPrivacy data (here with filename _HiZip.zip_) that were started on October, 3rd, 2019 or later. The following files will\nbe generated in folder _./my_output_dir_:  \n- JSON files with the raw JSON data of a single activity (_.json_ file extension).\n- HiTrack files with the unconverted source data of a single activity (no extension, filenames start with _HiTrack__).\n- Converted TCX files for upload to Strava (_.tcx_ file extension).\n \n```\n python Hitrava.py --zip HiZip.zip --json_export --from_date 2019-10-03 --output_dir my_output_dir\n```\n\n#### JSON file conversion example\nUse the command below to convert all activities available in the motion path JSON file from the requested Huawei \nPrivacy data that were started on October, 3rd, 2019 or later. Source HiTrack files and converted TCX files will be \ngenerated in folder _./my_output_dir/json_ \n```\n python Hitrava.py --json \"motion path detail data.json\" --from_date 2019-10-03 --output_dir my_output_dir/json\n```\nSame as above, but also create an additional export file for each converted activity containing the raw JSON data of\nthat activity from the motion path JSON file.\n``` \npython Hitrava.py --json \"motion path detail data.json\" --json_export --from_date 2019-10-03 --output_dir my_output_dir/json\n```\n\n#### Single file conversion examples\nThe example below converts extracted file HiTrack_12345678901212345678912 to HiTrack_12345678901212345678912.tcx in \nthe ./output directory\n```\npython Hitrava.py --file HiTrack_12345678901212345678912\n```\nThe next example converts extracted file HiTrack_12345678901212345678912 to HiTrack_12345678901212345678912.tcx in \nthe _./my_output_dir_ directory. The program logging level is set to display debug messages. The converted file is \nvalidated against the TCX XSD schema (requires xmlschema library and an internet connection). \n```\npython Hitrava.py --file HiTrack_12345678901212345678912 --output_dir my_output_dir --validate_xml --log_level DEBUG\n```\nThe following example converts an extracted file HiTrack_12345678901212345678912 to HiTrack_12345678901212345678912.tcx \nin the _./output_ directory and forces the sport to 'walking'. \n```\npython Hitrava.py --file HiTrack_12345678901212345678912 --sport Walk\n```\nThe next example converts an indoor swimming activity in an extracted file HiTrack_12345678901212345678912 to \nHiTrack_12345678901212345678912.tcx. The length of the pool in meters is specified to have a more accurate swimming data\ncalculation.  \n```\npython Hitrava.py --file HiTrack_12345678901212345678912 --pool_length 25\n```\n \n#### Tar file conversion examples\nThe first example extracts and converts any HiTrack file found in tar file com.huawei.health.tar into the _./output_ \ndirectory. The output directory will contain both the extracted HiTrack file and the converted TCX XML file. \n```\npython Hitrava.py --tar com.huawei.health.tar\n```\nIn the example below, only activities in the com.huawei.health.tar tarball that were started on August 20th, 2019 or \nlater will be extracted and converted to the _./output_ directory.\n```\npython Hitrava.py --tar com.huawei.health.tar --from_date 2019-08-20\n```\n  \n## Release Notes\nFor a full changelog of all versions, please look in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## Copyright and License\n[![nposl3.0][shield nposl3.0]][tldrlegal nposl3.0]  \n\nCopyright (c) 2019-2023 Christoph Vanthuyne\n\nLicensed under the Non-Profit Open Software License version 3.0 from Hitrava version 3.1.1 onward.  \n\nRead the full license information [`here`](./LICENSE.md).\n\nIf you're more into a TL;DR approach, start [`here`][tldrlegal nposl3.0].\n\n[shield nposl3.0]: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-nposl--3.0-blue\n[tldrlegal nposl3.0]: https://tldrlegal.com/license/non-profit-open-software-license-3.0-(nposl-3.0)\n[nposl3.0]: https://opensource.org/licenses/NPOSL-3.0\n[shield release]: https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/CTHRU/Hitrava?color=orange\n[shield release date]: https://img.shields.io/github/release-date/CTHRU/Hitrava?color=orange\n[latest release]: https://github.com/CTHRU/Hitrava/releases/latest\n[shield buymeacoffee]: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/guidelines/download-assets-sm-2.svg\n[buymeacoffee]: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/CTHRU\n[shield paypal]: https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif\n[paypal]: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=SSSHR299GZEKQ\n"

Fit is a \"compact binary\nformat designed for storing and sharing data from sport, fitness and health\ndevices\". Fit files are created by newer GPS enabled Garmin sport watches and\ncycling computers, such as the Forerunner/Edge/Fenix series.\n\nThe two latest versions of Go is supported. The core decoding package has no\nexternal dependencies. The latest release of Go and a few external dependencies\nare required for running the full test suite and benchmarks.\n\n**Latest release:** 0.15.0\n\n### Version Support\n\nThe current supported FIT SDK version is **21.115**.\n\nDeveloper data fields are currently only _partially_ supported.\nAt the moment the decoder parses Developer Data Field Descriptions, Developer Data ID Messages and Field Description Messages.\nThe decoder currently discards developer data fields found in records. \n\nThe encoder will currently (silently) ignore anything related to Developer data fields,\nThis also means that encoding will not fail if protocol version 2 is specified for a file header.\n\nDeveloper data fields support is tracked by\n[#21](https://github.com/tormoder/fit/issues/21)\nand\n[#64](https://github.com/tormoder/fit/issues/64).\n\n### Features\n\n* Supports all FIT file types.\n* Accessors for scaled fields.\n* Accessors for dynamic fields.\n* Field components expansion.\n* Go code generation for custom FIT product profiles.\n\n### Installation\n\nUsing Go modules:\n\n```\n$ go get github.com/tormoder/fit@v0.15.0\n```\n\nUsing `$GOPATH`:\n\n```\n$ go get github.com/tormoder/fit\n```\n\n### About fit\n\n- [Example Usage](https://github.com/tormoder/fit/wiki/Example-Usage)\n- [Data Types](https://github.com/tormoder/fit/wiki/Data-Types)\n- [Main API Reference](https://github.com/tormoder/fit/wiki/Main-Api-Reference)\n- [Custom Product Profiles](https://github.com/tormoder/fit/wiki/Custom-Product-Profiles)\n- [Upcoming Features](https://github.com/tormoder/fit/wiki/Upcoming-Features)\n- [Contributing](https://github.com/tormoder/fit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [License](https://github.com/tormoder/fit/wiki/License)\n\n### Contributors\n\n- [usedbytes](https://github.com/usedbytes)\n- [colinrgodsey](https://github.com/colinrgodsey)\n- [bpg](https://github.com/bpg)\n- [pieterclaerhout](https://github.com/pieterclaerhout)\n- [beyoung](https://github.com/beyoung)\n- [cloudlena](https://github.com/cloudlena)\n- [dudanian](https://github.com/dudanian)\n"

fixtures data as well as backtesting of\nbetting strategies.\n\n### Parameters\n\nAssume that we would like to fetch historical data of various leagues for specific years, including the maximum odds of the market\nand dropping columns that contain more than 20% of missing values:\n\n```python\nleagues = ['England', 'Scotland', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Spain', 'France', 'Netherlands', 'Belgium', 'Portugal', 'Turkey', 'Greece']\nyears = [2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023]\nodds_type = 'market_maximum'\ndrop_na_thres = 0.8\n```\n\nWe would like also to use a `GradientBoostingClassifier` to support our betting strategy:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.compose import make_column_transformer\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\nfrom sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputClassifier\nfrom sportsbet.evaluation import ClassifierBettor\n\nclassifier = make_pipeline(\n  make_column_transformer(\n    (OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'), ['league', 'home_team', 'away_team']), remainder='passthrough'\n  ),\n  SimpleImputer(),\n  MultiOutputClassifier(GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=5)),\n)\n```\n\nFinally, our backtesting parameters would include a 5-fold time ordered cross-validation and initial portfolio value of 1000:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit\ntscv = TimeSeriesSplit(5)\ninit_cash = 1000\n```\n\n### Process\n\nUsing the above selections, the betting process is the following:\n\n- Create a dataloader that is used to fetch the training and fixtures data.\n\n```python\nfrom sportsbet.datasets import SoccerDataLoader\ndataloader = SoccerDataLoader({'league': leagues, 'year': years})\nX_train, Y_train, O_train = dataloader.extract_train_data(drop_na_thres=drop_na_thres, odds_type=odds_type)\nX_fix, _, O_fix = dataloader.extract_fixtures_data()\n```\n\n- Create a bettor that selects and configures the betting strategy.\n\n```python\nfrom sportsbet.evaluation import ClassifierBettor\nbettor = ClassifierBettor(classifier)\n```\n\n- Backtest the bettor on the training data to evaluate the betting strategy:\n\n```python\nbettor.backtest(X_train, Y_train, O_train, tscv=tscv, init_cash=init_cash)\nbettor.backtest_results_[['Sharpe Ratio', 'Total Return [%]', 'Testing Period']].mean()\n```\n\n- Predict the value bets:\n\n```python\nbettor.bet(X_fix, O_fix)\n```\n\n## Sports betting in practice\n\nYou can think of any sports betting event as a random experiment with unknown probabilities for the various outcomes. Even for the\nmost unlikely outcome, for example scoring more than 10 goals in a soccer match, a small probability is still assigned. The\nbookmaker estimates this probability P and offers the corresponding odds O. In theory, if the bookmaker offers the so-called fair\nodds O = 1 / P in the long run, neither the bettor nor the bookmaker would make any money.\n\nThe bookmaker's strategy is to adjust the odds in their favor using the over-round of probabilities. In practice, it offers odds\nless than the estimated fair odds. The important point here is that the bookmaker still has to estimate the probabilities of\noutcomes and provide odds that guarantee them long-term profit.\n\nOn the other hand, the bettor can also estimate the probabilities and compare them to the odds the bookmaker offers. If the\nestimated probability of an outcome is higher than the implied probability from the provided odds, then the bet is called a value\nbet.\n\nThe only long-term betting strategy that makes sense is to select value bets. However, you have to remember that neither the\nbettor nor the bookmaker can access the actual probabilities of outcomes. Therefore, identifying a value bet from the side of the\nbettor is still an estimation. The bettor or the bookmaker might be wrong, or both of them.\n\nAnother essential point is that bookmakers can access resources that the typical bettor is rare to access. For instance, they have\nmore data, computational power, and teams of experts working on predictive models. You may assume that trying to beat them is\npointless, but this is not necessarily correct. The bookmakers have multiple factors to consider when they offer their adjusted\nodds. This is the reason there is a considerable variation among the offered odds. The bettor should aim to systematically\nestimate the value bets, backtest their performance, and not create arbitrarily accurate predictive models. This is a realistic\ngoal, and `sports-betting` can help by providing appropriate tools.\n\n## Installation\n\nFor user installation, `sports-betting` is currently available on the PyPi's repository, and you can install it via `pip`:\n\n```bash\npip install sports-betting\n```\n\nDevelopment installation requires to clone the repository and then use [PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) to install the\nproject as well as the main and development dependencies:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/georgedouzas/sports-betting.git\ncd sports-betting\npdm install\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use the Python API or the CLI to access the full functionality of `sports-betting`. Nevertheless, it is recommended to be\nfamiliar with the Python API since it is still needed to write configuration files for the CLI.\n\n### API\n\nThe `sports-betting` package makes it easy to download sports betting data:\n\n```python\nfrom sportsbet.datasets import SoccerDataLoader\ndataloader = SoccerDataLoader(param_grid={'league': ['Italy'], 'year': [2020]})\nX_train, Y_train, O_train = dataloader.extract_train_data(odds_type='market_maximum', drop_na_thres=1.0)\nX_fix, Y_fix, O_fix = dataloader.extract_fixtures_data()\n```\n\n`X_train` are the historical/training data and `X_fix` are the test/fixtures data. The historical data can be used to backtest the\nperformance of a bettor model:\n\n```python\nfrom sportsbet.evaluation import ClassifierBettor\nfrom sklearn.dummy import DummyClassifier\nbettor = ClassifierBettor(DummyClassifier())\nbettor.backtest(X_train, Y_train, O_train)\n```\n\nWe can use the trained bettor model to predict the value bets using the fixtures data:\n\n```python\nbettor.bet(X_fix, O_fix)\n```\n\n### CLI\n\nThe command `sportsbet` provides various sub-commands to download data and predict the value bets. For any sub-command you may\nadd the `--help` flag to get more information about its usage.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nIn order to use the commands, a configuration file is required. You can find examples of such configuration files in\n`sports-betting/configs/`. The configuration file should have a Python file extension and contain a dictionary `CONFIG`:\n\n```python\nCONFIG = {\n  'data': {\n    'dataloader': ...,\n    'param_grid': {\n\n    },\n    'drop_na_thres': ...,\n    'odds_type': ...\n  },\n  'betting': {\n    ...: ...,\n    'bettor': ...,\n    'tscv': ...,\n    'init_cash': ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe dictionary `CONFIG` has the following structure:\n\n- Two mandatory keys `'data'` and `'betting'` that configure the data extraction and betting strategy, respectively and contain\n  other nested dictionaries as values.\n- The `'data'` key has a nested dictionary as a value with a mandatory key '`dataloader`' and the optional keys `'param_grid'`,\n  `'drop_na_thres'` and `'drop_na'`. You can refer to the [API](api/datasets) for more details about their values.\n- The `'betting'` key has a nested dictionary as a value with a mandatory key '`bettor`' and the optional keys `'tscv'`, and\n  `'inti_cash'`. You can refer to the [API](api/datasets) for more details about their values.\n\n#### Dataloader\n\nShow available parameters for dataloaders:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet dataloader params -c config.py\n```\n\nShow available odds types:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet dataloader odds-types -c config.py\n```\n\nExtract training data and save them as CSV files:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet dataloader training -c dataloader_config.py -d /path/to/directory\n```\n\nExtract fixtures data and save them as CSV files:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet dataloader fixtures -c config.py -d /path/to/directory\n```\n\n#### Bettor\n\nBacktest the bettor and save the results as CSV file:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet bettor backtest -c config.py -d /path/to/directory\n```\n\nGet the value bets and save them as CSV file:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet bettor bet -c config.py -d /path/to/directory\n```"

        "readme_contents": "# Yahoo! Fantasy API Node Module\n\nThis is a node module created to wrap the Yahoo! Fantasy Sports API ([link](https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/index.html)). At the moment, not all subresources are available, nor are any of the 'collection' elements. I do hope to add them, and they have been added to the code, but as of now this project is very much in an open beta phase.\n\nThe API is designed to act as a helper for those interacting with the Y! Fantasy API. The goal is for ease of use for the user, both in terms of querying endpoints and parsing responses. I've noticed that in working with the API, the data is not always the easiest to understand, so hopefully what I have created here will help people out.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install the module via npm by running:\n\n    $ npm install yahoo-fantasy\n\n## Licence\n\nThis module is available under the [MIT Licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n## Documentation\n\nMore complete documentation can be found using the application sandbox ([Link](https://yahoo-fantasy-node-docs.vercel.app/)). This sandbox is always a work in progress, if I've learned anything it's that nothing is ever complete.\n\nThe API can be used by simply importing the module and querying data, since version 4.0 the authentication flow has been built into the library to make things easier for users.\n\n    // import the library\n    const YahooFantasy = require('yahoo-fantasy');\n\n    // you can get an application key/secret by creating a new application on Yahoo!\n    const yf = new YahooFantasy(\n      Y!APPLICATION_KEY, // Yahoo! Application Key\n      Y!APPLICATION_SECRET, // Yahoo! Application Secret\n      tokenCallbackFunction, // callback function when user token is refreshed (optional)\n      redirectUri // redirect endpoint when user authenticates (optional)\n    );\n\n    // you can authenticate a user by setting a route to call the auth function\n    // note: from v4.0 on, public queries are now supported; that is, you can query\n    // public resources without authenticating a user (ie/ game meta, player meta,\n    // and information from public leagues)\n    yf.auth(\n      response // response object to redirect the user to the Yahoo! login screen\n    )\n\n    // you also need to set up the callback route (defined as the redirect uri above)\n    // note: this will automatically set the user and refresh token if the request is\n    // successful, but you can also call them manually, described below\n    yf.authCallback(\n      request, // the request will contain the auth code from Yahoo!\n      callback // callback function that will be called after the token has been retrieved\n    )\n\n    // if you're not authenticating via the library you'll need to set the Yahoo!\n    // token for the user\n    yf.setUserToken(\n      Y!CLIENT_TOKEN\n    );\n\n    // you can do the same for the refresh token...\n    // if you set this and the token expires (lasts an hour) then the token will automatically\n    // refresh and call the above \"tokenCallbackFunction\" that you've specified to persist the\n    // token elsewhere\n    yf.setRefreshToken(\n      Y!CLIENT_REFRESH_TOKEN\n    );\n\n    // query a resource/subresource\n    yf.{resource}.{subresource} (\n      {possible argument(s)},\n      function cb(err, data) {\n        // handle error\n        // callback function\n        // do your thing\n      }\n    );\n\n### Starting with v3.1.0 you can also use a promise chain to query resources and subresources\n\n    yf.{resource}.{subresource} (\n      {possible argument(s)}\n    )\n    .then(data => // do your thing)\n    .catch(err => // handle error)\n\n### This also opens the door to use async/await in version of node that support it\n\n    try {\n      let data = await yf.{resource}.{subresource} (\n        {possible argument(s)}\n      )\n\n      // do your thing\n    } catch(err) {\n      // handle error\n    }\n\n## Bugs & Issues\n\nThis project is very much still a work in progress, please report any issues via the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/whatadewitt/yfsapi/issues).\n\n## Changelog\n\n### 5.2.2\n\n- Fixed a bug where transactions somehow didn't have players and would cause a crash\n\n### 5.2.1\n\n- Dependabot alert fixes\n\n### 5.2.0\n\n- Add support for `lastweek` and `lastmonth` as arguments in `player.stats` resource (Thanks to [nosecreek](https://github.com/nosecreek)!)\n\n### 5.1.0\n\n- Cleaned up the `user.game_leagues` function to have the `game.league` array be an array of objects instead of an array of a single array holding an object.\n\n### 5.0.0\n\n- My NextJS docs site was giving me grief about ESM/CJS imports so I made some changes that should work for whatever import method you want to use\n- Updated the `mapScoreboard` function that is used by the league resource to simplify the `stat_winners` array to show the winning `stat_id` and `team_key` (or `is_tied`), rather than having them nested inside a `stat_winner` object\n\n### 4.2.0\n\n- Fixed a bug where querying player stats for a given week wasn't working.\n- Updated the `player.stats` function to accept a week OR a date (format `yyyy-mm-dd`) as the 2nd param.\n- Fixed a bug that would cause the function to fail silently if trying to request stats for a given `week` for players outside of the NFL (for this you can just get the weeks from the game settings and make multiple queries for each day of the week).\n- Fixes [Issue #79](https://github.com/whatadewitt/yahoo-fantasy-sports-api/issues/79) (Big thanks to [jimweigandt](https://github.com/jimweigandt) and [rdbaron](https://github.com/rdbaron) for the help finding / debugging the issue)\n\n### 4.1.5\n\n- Fixed a bug where certain league settings were not loading properly for some older leagues. (merge [PR #80](https://github.com/whatadewitt/yahoo-fantasy-sports-api/pull/80)) (Thanks [connor4312](https://github.com/connor4312))\n\n### 4.1.4\n\n- Fixed a bug where the response from the token refresh was not being included in the promise chain. (merge [PR #78](https://github.com/whatadewitt/yahoo-fantasy-sports-api/pull/78)) (Thanks [connor4312](https://github.com/connor4312))\n\n### 4.1.3\n\n- Fixed a bug where Yahoo! apparently no longer requires `;type=week` when building a URL for team.stats and player.stats, leading to no stats coming back for those resources ([Issue #70](https://github.com/whatadewitt/yfsapi/issues/70\"))\n\n#### 4.1.2\n\n- Fixed bug where \"selected position\" was no longer working due to a change in the data format coming from Yahoo! (merge [PR #69](https://github.com/whatadewitt/yahoo-fantasy-sports-api/pull/69)) (Thanks [brisberg](https://github.com/brisberg))\n\n#### 4.1.1\n\n- Small change to the way the resource and collection files are being imported as it was causing issues on some hosts...\n\n#### 4.1.0\n\n- Maybe would have made sense as a 5.0.0 as there may be breaking changes, but I haven't been able to find any yet...\n- the authCallback() function will now return an object with the user's access_token and refresh_token\n- the auth() function will accept a \"state\" string, allowing for state persistence through the authentication process\n- re-enabled the transactions.fetch() collection call\n- cleaned up the \"wavier_days\" and \"stat_categories\" objects on league resources\n- added deprecation warnings to the game.leagues and game.players functions as they're not very useful in that context\n\n#### 4.0.0\n\n- Added auth(), authCallback, setRefreshToken() functions to the library\n- Automatically handle refreshing of the token and call a user defined function when the token has expired\n- Added support for public queries\n- General cleanup\n\n#### 3.2.0\n\n- Added \"players\" subresource to \"league\" in order to obtain weekly / season stats for a player based on league settings\n- Fixed a bug where the starting status wasn't properly being returned due to a shift in how the data was being returned\n- Removed use of \"request\" library for size and performance reasons\n- General code optimizations and improvements\n\n#### 3.1.2\n\n- Updated outdated dependencies\n\n#### 3.1.1\n\n- Resolve error when no team logo is present ([Issue #42](https://github.com/whatadewitt/yfsapi/issues/42))\n\n#### 3.1.0\n\n- Introduced `promise` based flow for all endpoints as an alternative to callbacks. Thanks [Marois](https://github.com/ryus08)!\n\n#### 3.0.4\n\n- Fixed a bug in the players.league collection call where it was trying to use split on an array... ([Issue #46](https://github.com/whatadewitt/yfsapi/pull/46\")).\n- Fixed similar bugs in other places...\n\n#### 3.0.3\n\n- Added the ability to specify a date or week when querying the `team.stats` resource.\n- Unit test fixes ([Issue #42](https://github.com/whatadewitt/yfsapi/issues/42)). Thanks [Marios](https://github.com/ryus08)!\n- Updated \"vulnerable\" dependencies.\n\n#### 3.0.2\n\n- Fixed an issue with the `user.game_leagues` resource, where the data was not at all user friendly (renamed `leagues` to `games` at the top level of the return object)\n\n#### 3.0.1\n\n- Fixed some typos in some import statements which caused issues on some servers\n\n#### 3.0.0\n\n- Major refactor to use ES6?... 2015? ...2018? Whatever the hell they're calling it now...\n- Using ES Modules (mjs) files where possible\n- Removed transactions collections (they'll be back!)\n\n#### 2.0.4\n\n- Added a fix to give a cleaner value for the new \"batting order\" attribute in the player oject.\n\n#### 2.0.3\n\n- Fixed a bug where the league players collection was not properly parsing the ownership subresource\n\n#### 2.0.2\n\n- Fixed a bug where \"mapTeamPoints\" helper function was not defining \"self\". Thanks [platky](https://github.com/platky)!\n\n#### 2.0.1\n\n- Removed the code that added a \"reason\" to errors coming from Yahoo! as it was breaking other errors. Retry notifications should now be handled within the application using the module.\n\n#### 2.0.0\n\n- Moved to Yahoo!'s OAuth2.0 authentication mechanism.\n\n#### 1.0.2\n\n- Fixed game resource roster postions callback bug.\n\n#### 1.0.1\n\n- Fixed a typo that was breaking team mapping.\n\n#### 1.0.0\n\n- Breaking changes\n- Fixed NFL scoreboard/matchups bug ([Issue #19](https://github.com/whatadewitt/yfsapi/issues/19))\n- In fixing this bug I realized that my \"team\" set up was really only useful for MLB fantasy, so I rewrote team mapping to work better across all sports and give additional details that weren't previously reported. This will cause errors if you are using the team.manager attribute in your code.\n\n#### 0.5.3\n\n- Fixed a bug where leagueFetch was throwing an error, thanks [danielspector](https://github.com/danielspector)!\n\n#### 0.5.2\n\n- Fixed a bug where player stats by week url was not being created properly, thanks [withsmilo](https://github.com/withsmilo)!\n\n#### 0.5.1\n\n- Fixed a bug where collections that contained subresources would return no data.\n\n#### 0.5.0\n\n- Added \"Transactions\" collection with functionality to add players, drop players, and add/drop players, thanks again [githubsmilo](https://github.com/githubsmilo)!\n\n#### 0.4.4\n\n- Fixed a bug in player.draft_analysis, thanks [githubsmilo](https://github.com/githubsmilo)!\n\n#### 0.4.3\n\n- Added weeks param for league.scoreboard\n- Added weeks param for team.matchups\n- Fixed a bug where individual players weren't mapping properly\n- Minor code cleanup\n\n#### 0.4.2\n\n- Added the ability to specify a date or week when querying the roster resource.\n- Cleaned up the player normalization model\n- Fixed a bug where the team.roster call was erroring\n\n#### 0.4.1\n\n- Fixes to how POST data is handled\n\n#### 0.4.0\n\n- Significantly restructured the code to have more consistency and set it up better for future plans, namely POST methods and proper unit testing\n- Removed the \"refresh user token\" and instead return the error to the user who can handle the refresh within their application.\n\n#### 0.3.1\n\n- Additional player attributes added, thanks [ryus08](https://github.com/ryus08)!\n\n#### 0.3.0\n\n- Added a method to refresh the user's token if it has expired.\n\n#### 0.2.2\n\n- Hotfix to fix \"Teams\" collection - use error first convention\n\n#### 0.2.0\n\n- Made helper classes more consistent\n- Added collections for games, leagues, players, and teams\n- Moved to error first convention because JavaScript\n\n#### 0.1.2\n\n- Added 'Team Matchups' subresource\n- Added 'League Scoreboard' subresource\n- Minor code cleanup and improvements\n\n#### 0.1.1\n\n- Refactored module to fix a bug where user sessions were not necessarily unique because of require caching.\n\n#### 0.1\n\n- Initial release.\n"

        "language": "R",
        "readme_contents": "# ncaahoopR <img src=\"figures/logo.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n`ncaahoopR` is an R package for working with NCAA Basketball Play-by-Play Data. It scrapes play-by-play data and returns it to the user in a tidy format, allowing the user to explore the data with assist networks, shot charts, and in-game win-probability charts.\n\nFor pre-scraped schedules, rosters, box scores, and play-by-play data, check out the [ncaahoopR_data repository](https://github.com/lbenz730/ncaahoopR_data).\n\nTo see the lastest changes in version 1.5, view the change log [here](https://lukebenz.com/post/ncaahoopr_v1.5/).\n\n## Installation\nYou can install `ncaahoopR` from GitHub with:\n\n``` r\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"lbenz730/ncaahoopR\")\n```\n\nIf you encounter installation issues, the following tips have helped a few users successfully install the package:\n\n* If given the option to compile any packages from source rather than installing existing binaries, choose `'No'`.\n* Windows users with trouble installing the package should try running the following command before reinstalling the package: `Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS = \"true\")`\n* Windows users with trouble installing `devtools` should try first installing the `backports` package via `install.packages(\"backports\")`.\n\n\n## Functions\nSeveral functions use ESPN game_ids. You can find the game_id in the URL for the game summary, \nas shown in the URL for the summary of the UMBC-Virginia game below.\n![game_id](figures/espn.png)\n\n### Scraping Data\n* ```get_pbp(team, season)```: Get entire current season's worth of play-by-play data for a given team and season. `season` defaults to current season, but can be specified in \"2019-20\" form. \n* ```get_pbp_game(game_ids, extra_parse)```:  Get play-by-play data for a specific vector of ESPN game_ids. `extra_parse` is a logical whether to link shot variables and attempt possesion parsing. Default =   `TRUE`.\n* ```get_roster(team, season)```: Get a particular team's roster. `season` defaults to current season, but can be specified in \"2019-20\" form. \n* ```get_schedule(team, season)```: Get a team's schedule. `season` defaults to current season, but can be specified in \"2019-20\" form. \n* ```get_game_ids(team, season)```: Get a vector of ESPN game_ids for all games involving ```team``` specified. `season` defaults to current season, but can be specified in \"2019-20\" form.\n* ```get_master_schedule(date)```: Get schedule of all games for given date. Use `YYYY-MM-DD` date formatting.\n* `get_boxscore(game_id)`: Returns list of 2 data frames, one with each teams' box score for the game in question. Written by [Jared Andrews](https://github.com/j-andrews7).\n\n* `season_boxscore(team, season = current_season, aggregate = 'average')`: Returns (aggregated) player stats over the course of a season for a given team.\n        * `team`: team to return player stats for.\n        * `season`: of form YYYY-YY. Defaults to current season.\n        * `aggregate`: one of 'average' (per-game average statistics), 'total' (sums of season stats) or 'raw' (just return all box scores binded together). 'average' is the default. Contributed in collaboration with [Kurt Wirth](https://github.com/kurtawirth)\n\nThe `team` parameter in the above functions must be a valid team name from the `ids` dataset built into the package. See the __Datasets__ section below for more details.\n\n### Win-Probability and Game-Flow Charts\n\n__Win Probability Charts__\n\nThe latest function for plotting win probability charts is `wp_chart_new`. Following the 2021-22 season other win probability chart functions will be deprecated and replaced by this function (it will be renamed to `wp_chart` but I don't want to break any existing pipelines during the season). It no longer requires users to input colors. For best results consider saving via ggsave(filename, height = 9/1.2, width = 16/1.2) (or some other 16/9 aspect ratio.) \n\n```wp_chart_new(game_id, home_col = NULL, away_col = NULL, include_spread = T, show_legend = T)```\n\n* ```game_id``` ESPN game_id for the desired contest.\n* ```home_col``` Chart color for home team (if NULL will default to `ncaa_colors` primary_color field).\n* ```away_col```: Chart color for away team (if NULL will default to `ncaa_colors` primary_color field).\n* `include_spread`: Logical, whether to include pre-game spread in Win Probability calculations. Default = `TRUE`.\n* ```show_legend```: Logical, whether or not to show legend/text on chart. Default = `TRUE`.\n\n\nA prior version of `wp_chart` used base R while `gg_wp_chart` used the `ggplot2` plotting library. As of the 2020-21 season, both functions call the same `ggplot2` library, and `gg_wp_chart` now simply aliases `wp_chart`\n\n```wp_chart(game_id, home_col, away_col, include_spread = T, show_legend = T)```\n\n* ```game_id``` ESPN game_id for the desired contest.\n* ```home_col``` Chart color for home team.\n* ```away_col```: Chart color for away team.\n* `include_spread`: Logical, whether to include pre-game spread in Win Probability calculations. Default = `TRUE`.\n* ```show_legend```: Logical, whether or not to show legend/text on chart. Default = `TRUE`.\n\n\n```gg_wp_chart(game_id, home_col, away_col, show_labels = T)```\n\n* ```game_id``` ESPN game_id for the desired contest.\n* ```home_col``` Chart color for home team.\n* ```away_col```: Chart color for away team.\n* `include_spread`: Logical, whether to include pre-game spread in Win Probability calculations. Default = `TRUE`.\n* `show_labels`: Logical whether Game Excitement Index and Minimum Win Probability metrics should be displayed on the plot. Default = `TRUE`.\n\n__Game Flow Charts__\n\n```game_flow(game_id, home_col, away_col)```\n\n* ```game_id``` ESPN game_id for the desired contest.\n* ```home_col``` Chart color for home team.\n* ```away_col``` Chart color for away team.\n\n__Game Excitement Index__\n\n```game_exciment_index(game_id, include_spread = T)```\n\n* `include_spread`: Logical, whether to include pre-game spread in Win Probability calculations.

Useful for computation of win probability added (WPA).\n* ```home_timeout_remaining```: Number of timeouts remaining for the home team.\n* ```away_timeout_remaining```: Number of timeouts remaining for the away team.\n* ```home_favored_by```: Number of points by which the home team is favored, prior to tip-off. If Vegas point spread is available on ESPN, that is used as the default. When not available, an attempt is made to impute the pre-game point spread from derived team strengths. Imputed point spreads are not available for games prior to the 2016-17 season or when one of the teams is not in Division 1.\n* ```total_line```: Total Vegas over/under for the game, where available.\n* ```referees``` Referees for the game.\n* `arena_location`: City in which the game was played.\n* `arena`: Name of arena where game was played.\n* `capacity`: Capacity of arena where game was played.\n* `attendance`: Attendance of game, where available.\n* `wrong_time`: An attempt to label play-by-play events tagged at the wrong time. These are filtered out of all graphical and statistical helper functions, but may still be useful for certain analyses where time of event is of less importance.\n\nIf `extra_parse = TRUE` in `get_pbp_game`, the following variables are also included.\n\n* `shot_x`: The half-court x coordinate of shot. \n* `shot_y`: The half-court y coordinate of shot. (0,0) represents the bottom left corner and (50, 47) represents the top right corner (from persepective of standing under hoop).\n* `shot_team`: Name of team taking shot.\n* `shot_outcome`: Whether the shot was `made` or `missed`.\n* `shooter`: Name of player taking shot.\n* `assist`: Name of player asssisting shot (assisted shots only)\n* `three_pt`: Logical, if shot is 3-point field goal attempt.\n* `free_throw`: Logical, if shot is free throw attempt.\n\n---\nStand-alone shot location data frames contain the following variables.\n\n* `team_name`: Name of shooting team.\n* `shot_text`: Description of shot.\n* `color`: Color hexcode used to render shot chart graphic on ESPN.\n* `date`: Date of game\n* `outcome`: Whether the shot was made or missed\n* `shooter`: Player attempting the shot\n* `assister`: Playing assisting the shot\n* `three_pt`: Logical, whether the shot is a 3-point attempt\n* `x`: x-coordinate of shot location\n* `y`: y-coordinate of shot location\n\n#### Raw Shot Location Data\n\nThe court is 94 feet long (baseline to baseline, interior) and 50 feet wide (sideline to sideline, interior). The court's origin is located at center court, with the court being displayed in a horizontal fashion (the baskets lie along the `x` axis). In this coordinate grid, `-x` corresponds to the left basket and `+x` to the right. `+y` corresponds to the upper sideline of the court, and `-y` to the lower.\n\nFollowing ESPN's convention, the home team's shot locations are on the `+x` basket, and the visiting team's on the `-y` basket. The center of each basket is at `(+/-41.75, 0)`.\n\nThe data pulled via `get_shot_locs()` follows this orientation.\n\n#### Shot Chart Data\n\nFor the shot chart functions, the `x` and `y` coordinates are \"flipped\" such that the court is oriented vertically, and each team would appear to be shooting on the same basket. That is, the home team and away team are both shooting on a basket centered at `(0, -41.75)`. This is done out of convenience and does not affect any underlying analyses\n"

In the *functions.py* script, I distinguished 4 types of sports, according to the sport-related format of outcome (either 1X2, 12, and various types of score : tennis-alike, football-alike, baseball-alike, hockey-like (the format is different for hockey on oddsportal website) ). <br />\n\nWith the emergence of sports analytics and machine learning, it has become possible for anyone to create data-based betting strategies, taking into considerations both market-related figures (odds values, variations, differentials between bookmakers) and sport-related metrics of performance of any team. In order to perform this task, the very minimal data required is the historical results and betting odds (closing odds are usually preferred) which you can then use to create Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to infer probabilities of victories, and to analyze whether any given team is being undervalued or overvalued by any given bookmaker. The oddsportal website is one of the largest publicly open odds database, however its format and architecture are not very pleasing to deal with, therefore one need a bit of time to build tools to collect the data on their website. This package offers a comprehensive interface (sort of unofficial API) to collect odds and save the data into a comprehensive csv format. <br />\n\n[1] https://www.oddsportal.com/ <br />\n\nNB : This package is purposed for educational use only, not for any commmercial purpose in any way. I am not related by any mean with the oddsportal website. <br/>\n\nBTC : 3PkoHLXmXsL8kBrFu7GQ8kpmzPBmNK6m8B <br/>\nETH : 0xFdbB5aF291cB7e711D62c1E4a8B58d0EbD423F9C\n\n"

Designed for pros and amateurs alike, we convert raw game footage into actionable data.\n\nWe're kicking off with soccer and expanding to other sports soon. Need to quantify your game? Make human movement computable with SportsLabKit.\n\n\n## Features\n\n### Core Capabilities\n- **High-Performance Tracking**: In-house implementations of SORT, DeepSORT, ByteTrack, and TeamTrack for object tracking in sports.\n\n### Flexibility\n- **Plug-and-Play Architecture**: Swap out detection and ReID models on the fly. Supported models include YOLOv8 and torch-ReID.\n\n### Usability\n- **2D Pitch Calibration**: Translate bounding boxes to 2D pitch coordinates.\n  \n- **DataFrame Wrappers**: `BoundingBoxDataFrame` and `CoordinatesDataFrame` for effortless manipulation and analysis of tracking data.\n\n### Tutorials\n- [**Get Started**](./notebooks/01_get_started): Your first steps in understanding and setting up SportsLabKit.\n- [**User Guide**](./notebooks/02_user_guide): A comprehensive guide for effectively using the toolkit in real-world scenarios.\n- [**Core Components**](./notebooks/03_core_components/): Deep dive into the essential elements that make up SportsLabKit, including tracking algorithms and DataFrame wrappers.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install SportsLabKit, simply run:\n\n```bash\npip install SportsLabKit\n```\n\n> **Note**: We're in active development, so expect updates and changes.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nTo get started with tracking your first game, follow this simple example:\n\n```python\nimport sportslabkit as slk\n\n# Initialize your camera and models\ncam = slk.Camera(path_to_mp4)\ndet_model = slk.detection_model.load('YOLOv8x')\nmotion_model = slk.motion_model.load('KalmanFilter')\n\n# Configure and execute the tracker\ntracker = slk.mot.SORTTracker(detection_model=det_model, motion_model=motion_model)\nbbdf = tracker.track(cam)\n\n# The tracking data is now ready for analysis\n```\n\nThe output is a `BoundingBoxDataFrame`, a multi-level Pandas DataFrame that contains Team ID, Player ID, and various attributes like bounding box dimensions. Each row is indexed by Frame ID for easy analysis. The DataFrame is also customizable, allowing you to adapt Team and Player IDs as needed.\n\n![Example of BoundingBoxDataFrame](./docs/_static/soccertrack_dataframe.png)\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- **Better CV tools**: Implement state of the art tracking methods, add event detection etc.\n\n- **Unified Data Representation**: In the pipeline are event data detection and a single DataFrame structure for both event and trajectory data.\n  \n- **Enhanced Compatibility**: Upcoming support for data export to standard formats for easy integration with other tools.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee the [Contributing Guide](./contributing.md) for more information.\n\n\n## Contributors\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-BADGE:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->\n[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-2-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors-)\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-BADGE:END -->\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n<!-- markdownlint-disable -->\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"14.28%\"><a href=\"https://atomscott.me/\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22371492?v=4?s=100\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"Atom Scott\"/><br /><sub><b>Atom Scott</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"#maintenance-AtomScott\" title=\"Maintenance\">\ud83d\udea7</a></td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"14.28%\"><a href=\"https://github.com/IkumaUchida\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48281753?v=4?s=100\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"Ikuma Uchida\"/><br /><sub><b>Ikuma Uchida</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"#tutorial-IkumaUchida\" title=\"Tutorials\">\u2705</a></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<!-- markdownlint-restore -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->\n\nThis project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification.

Specifics for how the tournament marquee feature works can be seen in this [video](https://youtu.be/WBEA_SmRqmQ).\n\n## Repository Overview\n\nThis repo is managed using git flow. The latest code is in the develop branch.\n\nTeammate is a fully featured modern Android team management app that:\n\n* Is offline first\n* Is pseudo single activity and heavily fragment dependent (It's got 2. Registration is it's own activity and flow, the rest of the app is the ```MainActivity```)\n* Uses the latest iteration of material design including expandable Floating Action Buttons, vertical drawer navigation, bottom sheets and the like.\n* Makes animation and transitions a priority and treats them as first class parts of the user experience.\n* Is Android Q edge to edge ready.\n* Highly themeable and dark mode compatible, checkout the feature/nike branch for a Nike inspired theme.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nTeammate is a MVVM Android Application that depends heavily on Functional Reactive Programming\n(RxJava) and the Android Architecture Components to function.\n\nOn a high level, it makes the following assumptions:\n\n* `Model` objects are effectively final from a UI perspective. Should a `Model` object be changed as a result of an IO call,\nthe actual reference to the object need not change, rather it's internal transient state should be updated.\n* Lists of items are effectively final within the lifecycle of the ```View``` displaying it.\nThe items within the list may change as a result of IO calls, but the list reference itself must never point to a new List instance.\n* All `Model` objects displayed to the user can be represented as a list of smaller, discrete items and these items can be displayed in a simple `RecyclerView` `ViewHolder`.\n* Manipulation of the `ViewHolder` by the user of the app, should change the underlying item it is bound to, and therefore the enclosing `Model`.\n* Data changes should always be represented as a reactive stream where possible (`Flowable`, `Single`, etc). This makes it easier to reuse logic all through the app.\n* Imperative style code for updating UI should be avoided where possible. updates to UI\nshould be contained within the `bind()` method of a `ViewHolder` near exclusively. This way the state of the UI can only be changed by binding and rebinding a `ViewHolder`.\n\nThese assumptions are realized via the following core objects:\n\n### MainActivity\n\nThe main `Activity` of this app can be considered a Controller of ViewControllers (```Fragments```) and persistent global views.\nIt handles The ```UiState``` object which is responsible for the presentation of global persistent UI like Toolbars, Floating Action Buttons, Bottom Sheets and SnackBars.\nThe navigation of this app makes sure every single full screen destination is added to the back stack. Any destination that is deemed transient, and shouldn't be in the back stack, for example picker or selector screens, will be shown via a sliding up bottom sheet.\nThis makes shared element transitions, of which there are a lot of in this app, simple to create, and maintain.\n\n### RecyclerView\n\nBesides the sign up flow and a few others, all data is presented in a RecyclerView. Model objects of any kind are broken up into Lists of `Differentiable` implementations\nand bound to their respective `ViewHolders`. UI Changes are broadcast solely through `diffResult.dispatchUpdatesTo(RecyclerView)` or `RecyclerView.notifyDataSetChanged()`.\nThat is, the UI typically has little to no idea the type of the model it binds to, it merely notifies the adapter it hosts of changes.\n```InputViewHolder``` is a fine example of this, and is particularly interesting because it's backed by a ```RecycledViewPool``` cached in the ```MainActivity```. It forms the basis for any ```View``` that presents a \"form\" to the user.\n\n### Differentiable\n\nAn `Differentiable` is the basic building block of this app. It represents an item that can change and therefore is \"Diff-able\", so a ```List``` of it can\nbe diffed against another ```List``` and the result dispatched to the hosting `RecyclerView`.\n\n### Repos\n\nStateless (mostly, ```UserRepo``` is the only exception and can be reworked.) singleton objects that perform IO work and publish the result of that work as Reactive wrappers around `Model` objects. All reactive objects exposed by them are published on a background thread, no exceptions.\nShould any of these reactive objects need to reach a ```View```, they must go through a ```ViewModel``` which will perform all necessary operations to convert it to a reactive object the ```View``` is concerned with; this is typically a ```DiffUtil.DiffResult```.\n\n### ViewModels\n\nLiaison between `Repositories` and `Views`. Most often converts a reactive `Model` type, to a reactive `DiffResult` type to publish on the UI thread. They also hold most application state, and may communicate with each other as some `Models` (```Teams``` and ```Roles```)are interdependent.\n\n### Gofers\n\nLike their name [suggests](https://youtu.be/zd5M5K5QtrM?t=56s), they communicate to a `ViewModel` changes to an individual `Differentiable` that may be part of a larger list.\nThis is especially useful if the `Model` is invalidated and has to be deleted from the parent list in the `ViewModel`.\n\n### Notifier\n\nResponsible for creating push notifications of `Models`. Think of them as ```Repositories``` for notifications.\n\n## UI Overview\n\nWith the architecture defined above, various UI manipulations can be abstracted out and delegated to specialized objects.\nSome of these are:\n\n### ScrollManager\n\nAn object which makes its easier to add UI characteristics to Lists such ass endless scrolling, pull to refresh, and notifying of `Model` changes.\nIt is an extension of the ListManager class, ScrollManager was created first, then eventually abstracted out to ListManager as a downstream dependency.\n\n### FabIconAnimator\n\nAn object that keeps track of the current drawable and text displayed in the Floating Action Button and animates it as appropriate.\n\n## Miscellaneous Notes\n\n* Besides a few Room Migration tests, the app is devoid of tests because the iteration pace was so quick, and remains so,\nwriting Unit tests for the business logic would have discouraged major app refactoring; and this app has seen a lot of them.\nSince it's a startup app and I'm the major contributor, Tests we put on the backlog.\n\n* Iconography in the app is represented mostly using vector drawables which help keep the size of the app down.\n\n* The app uses Java generics heavily, because I am a huge fan of the level of abstraction they facilitate, but also abuses them in some ways.\nThe compiler warnings fought in the writing of `TeamMemberRepository` was a very enlightening experience.\n\n* Working with shared element transitions between fragments was a very fulfilling experience.\n\n* The minimum sdk level is set to 21 only because of the app's heavy dependency on `ViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener`.\n\nSome very opinionated Android specific decisions to note if you're interested, otherwise please skip to the next section:\n\n* Why not Kotlin? I started this in 2017. At the time I was choosing between learning a backend / web stack or building this with Kotlin. I chose the former, and I think it was the right choice.\nI've recently started learning and working with Kotlin professionally and should be up to speed pretty soon.\n\n    EDIT: The app has now been migrated to Kotlin.\n\n* Why no Dagger? While I love dependency injection, I actively despise Dagger for it's opaqueness, slow build times, and infamously verbose compile time errors.\nThe latter has been greatly improved recently, but I think for an Android App of this size, Dagger is overkill.\nNow this is hardly backed up by much, however the things that would be injected in this app are the ```repositories``` and ```notifiers```, and that job is done by\nthe ```RepoProviders``` and ```NotifierProviders``` respectively, are provided via the service locator pattern and can very easily be mocked. I don't think I'm missing out on much.\n\n* Why Picasso and not Glide? I love dependencies with small binaries and a focused feature set that doesn't try to do too much.\nGlide is amazing, but this app doesn't support gifs, and Picasso works very well. There's no reason to bloat the app for a feature it doesn't need.\nThe resulting app is not multidex, and the size of the apk off Google play is less than 4 MB. That is a metric I am incredibly proud of for such a fully featured app.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Adetunji Dahunsi\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

        "readme_contents": "# Team Colors\n\n![TeamColors screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/XbWE9cG.png)\n\n[Team Colors](http://jim-nielsen.com/teamcolors) is a reference of HEX, RGB, CMYK, and Pantone color values of major league sports teams.\n\n## How-To\n\nInstall: `yarn install`\nDevelopment: `yarn start`\nBuild: `yarn build`\n\n## How It Works\n\nSite is built on the react framework. `index.html` is the shell container for react app. If javascript is not supported, a link is shown to the raw JSON data which has all color information.\n\nColor data is housed in a single `.json` file `src/teams.json`. Any changes to team colors can be done there. _Note on colors_: Color definitions for each team are in arrays and grouped by color mode. Color values should match index position in the array across color modes, for example:\n\n```\ncolors:\n  rgb: TEAMS-RGB-BLUE, TEAMS-RGB-RED\n  hex: TEAMS-HEX-BLUE, TEAMS-HEX-RED\n```\n\nSource artwork for each team is grouped by league in `sketch`. Production versions of these logo should be in `.svg` format in `public/img`.\n\n### Edit Team Color or Name\n\nFind teams `.json` file in `src/teams.json`, and edit the info you need.\n\n### Add a Team\n\n1. Determine the team\u2019s league\n2. Following the established pattern, add the team\u2019s name and colors the `.json` file\n3. Add a vector logo for the team in its corresponding `.sketch` league file in `sketch` with the team\u2019s name (as referenced in its `.json` file) in lowercase with hyphens, i.e. \"utah-jazz\"\n4. Export the team\u2019s `.svg` logo to `public/img/`\n5. Preferably, optimize the svg (with a tool like [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo))\n6. Run `yarn build`, commit, push\n\n## Official Color References\n\n### NBA\n\nAll NBA colors are official ([source](http://courtside.nba.com/QuickPlace/nbalogo/Main.nsf/$defaultview/AD4C002C7D0F37A285257D660058EAED/$File/NBA%20Primary%20Composite_14-15PLAYOFFS.pdf?OpenElement) user & pass: nbamedia).\n\nThe NBA only provides RGB, CMYK, and Pantone colors for each team, so the HEX color is a programmatic conversion of the RGB color.\n\n### NFL\n\nAll NFL colors are official (see sources below).\n\nThe NFL provides official RGB, HEX, CMYK, and Pantone colors (so none of the colors you see on Team Colors are conversions).\n\nThe NFL has logo slicks which detail team color values. These are provided on a per-conference basis. _Note_: each of these source links are over 100MB in size, so they take a while to download.\n\n- [AFC North](http://www.nflmedia.com/afc_north.zip)\n- [AFC South](http://www.nflmedia.com/afc_south.zip)\n- [AFC East](http://www.nflmedia.com/afc_east.zip)\n- [AFC West](http://www.nflmedia.com/afc_west.zip)\n- [NFC North](http://www.nflmedia.com/nfc_north.zip)\n- [NFC South](http://www.nflmedia.com/nfc_south.zip)\n- [NFC East](http://www.nflmedia.com/nfc_east.zip)\n- [NFC West](http://www.nflmedia.com/nfc_west.zip)\n\n### MLB\n\nMLB colors have been extracted from the official \u201cRGB Digital Art\u201d spot color logo slicks provided at [MLB Press Box](http://mlbpressbox.mlbstyleguide.com) (user account required). They were not explicitly stated values, but they are color values pulled from individual team logos in an _official_ MLB document.\n\nThe extracted colors are in HEX form and their RGB counterparts are generated programmatically.\n\n- [American League logo slick](http://i.imgur.com/RP5kBSI.png)\n- [National League logo slick](http://i.imgur.com/FcuizSx.png)\n\n### NHL\n\nNHL colors are official. As per [Michael Sharer](https://github.com/epitaphmike) of the NHL.\n\n### MLS\n\nMLS colors are currently approximations, with the exceptions listed below. I am working on getting official colors of the remaining teams.\n\n- [Philadelphia Union](http://portfolios.scad.edu/gallery/36587433/Philadelphia-Union-Brand-Guidelines)\n\n### EPL\n\nThese leagues\u2019 teams and colors are currently approximations. I am working on getting official colors. If you know how/where to find them, please open an issue here in Github.\n\n## To-Dos\n\n- [ ] Switch to `flex` for layout\n- [ ] Improve filtering with fuzzy string search\n- [ ] Improve error states for when data doesn't render\n- [ ] Consider alternatives to no-js users rather than just \"here's the raw data\" (something that doesn't required a build if a single color in the JSON file is changed)\n- [ ] Possibly add team `id` manually to JSON file ??\n"

It allows for easy retrieval and parsing of almost any data you might wish to extract and use from any Yahoo fantasy league to which your Yahoo account has access (or for public leagues). The primary focus of this wrapper is on fantasy football (NFL), but it also supports usage with fantasy hockey (NHL), fantasy baseball (MLB), and fantasy basketball (NBA). \n\n---\n\n<a name=\"installation\"></a>\n### Installation\n\n#### Pip\n\n* If you wish to use YFPY within another project, from within your project directory, run\n    ```shell\n    pip install yfpy\n    ```\n    \n    or add `yfpy` to your project `requirements.txt`.\n\n#### Manual\n\n* If you wish to download and use YFPY locally, clone the git repository:\n  ```shell\n  git clone git@github.com:uberfastman/yfpy.git\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<a name=\"setup\"></a>\n### Setup\n\n#### Yahoo Developer Network App\n\nIn order to use YFPY with private fantasy leagues, you must set up an app on your Yahoo account to allow access. Follow the step-by-step guide below for instructions on how to do so, or see [Getting Started](https://developer.yahoo.com/oauth2/guide/openid_connect/getting_started.html) in the Yahoo Developer Network docs for more details.\n\n**Note:** *If you are only planning on using YFPY to pull \"read only\" data from public leagues, you do not need to do this.*\n\n* Log in to a Yahoo account with access to whatever fantasy leagues from which you wish to retrieve data.\n* Go to [https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/create/](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/create/) and create an app (you must be logged into your Yahoo account as stated above). For the app, select the following options:\n    * `Application Name` (**Required**): `yfpy` (you can name your app whatever you want, but this is just an example).\n    * `Application Type` (**Required**): select the `Installed Application` radio button.\n    * `Description` (*Optional*): you *may* write a short description of what the app does.\n    * `Home Page URL` (*Optional*): if you have a web address related to your app you *may* add it here.\n    * `Redirect URI(s)` (**Required**): this field must contain a valid redirect address, so you can use `https://localhost:8080`\n    * `API Permissions` (**Required**): check the `Fantasy Sports` checkbox. You can leave the `Read` option selected (appears in an accordion expansion underneath the `Fantasy Sports` checkbox once you select it).\n    * Click the `Create App` button.\n    * Once the app is created, it should redirect you to a page for your app, which will show both a `Client ID` and a `Client Secret`.\n    * Make a copy of [`auth/EXAMPLE.private.json`](https://github.com/uberfastman/yfpy/blob/main/auth/EXAMPLE.private.json), rename it to just `private.json`, and copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` values to their respective fields (make sure the strings are wrapped regular quotes (`\"\"`), NOT formatted quotes (`\u201c\u201d`)). The path to this file will be needed to point YFPY to your credentials.\n    * Now you should be ready to initialize the OAuth2 connection between YFPY your Yahoo account.\n\n---\n\n<a name=\"usage\"></a>\n### Usage\n\n#### Authentication\n\n* Follow the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) and [Setup](#setup) sections.\n* The ***first*** time you use YFPY, a browser window will open up asking you to allow your app to access your Yahoo fantasy sports data. You ***MUST*** hit allow, and then copy the verification code that pops up into the command line prompt where it will now be asking for verification, hit enter, and the OAuth2 three-legged handshake should be complete and your data should have been successfully retrieved.\n* YFPY should have now generated a `token.json` for you in the same directory where you stored your `private.json` credentials, and for all subsequent runs of your app, you should be able to keep retrieving Yahoo fantasy sports data using YFPY without re-verifying, since the generated refresh token should now just renew whenever you use the same `token.json` file to authenticate your app.\n\n#### Querying the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API\n\n* See the documentation on the  [`yfpy.query.YahooFantasySportsQuery`](https://yfpy.uberfastman.com/_autosummary/yfpy.query.YahooFantasySportsQuery.html#yfpy.query.YahooFantasySportsQuery) class for example usage of all available queries.\n* See [`quickstart/quickstart.py`](https://github.com/uberfastman/yfpy/blob/main/quickstart/quickstart.py) for example usage output.\n  * Uncomment/comment out whichever configuration values in their respective functions with which you wish to experiment.\n  * Uncomment/comment out whichever query lines in the `RUN QUERIES` section you wish to run.\n  * Uncomment/comment out whichever query lines in the `CHECK FOR MISSING DATA FIELDS` section you wish to check for any new/missing data fields returned by the Yahoo Sports Fantasy Football API.\n\n---\n\n<a name=\"testing\"></a>\n### Testing\n\nYFPY has a collection of fully functional code snippets that can be run using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/). These snippets demonstrate how to use YFPY to retrieve your Yahoo Fantasy Sports data.\n\n#### Unit\n\n* See the [`test/unit`](https://github.com/uberfastman/yfpy/blob/main/test/unit/) directory for example code snippets using pytest.\n\n#### Integration\n\n* See the [`test/integration`](https://github.com/uberfastman/yfpy/blob/main/test/integration/) directory for example code snippets using pytest.\n* Before running any integration tests, make a copy of [`auth/EXAMPLE.env`](https://github.com/uberfastman/yfpy/blob/main/auth/EXAMPLE.env) in the [`auth/`](https://github.com/uberfastman/yfpy/blob/main/auth/) directory and rename it to `.env`.\n* Copy your Yahoo `Client ID` and `Client Secret` into the environment variables in `.env` so that pytest can use them when hitting the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API.\n* If this is the first time running pytest with your Yahoo API credentials, you ***MUST*** allow interactive prompts within pytest by using the `-s` flag.\n* The fixture values in [`test/integration/conftest.py`](https://github.com/uberfastman/yfpy/blob/main/test/integration/conftest.py) are defined in [`quickstart/quickstart.py`](https://github.com/uberfastman/yfpy/blob/main/quickstart/quickstart.py), and can be changed for testing by uncommenting/commenting out the values inside each respective function.\n\n#### Running\n\n* You can invoke all pytest tests (both integration test and unit tests) by running the below from the root directory:\n  * `pytest -v -s`\n* If you want to run only the unit tests, you can run:\n  * `pytest -v -s -m unit`\n* If you want to run only the integration tests, you can run:\n  * `pytest -v -s -m integration`\n\n---\n\n<a name=\"dependencies\"></a>\n### Dependencies\n\n#### Platform\n\nYFPY has only been tested extensively on macOS, but is written to be platform-agnostic, and seems to work without issue on Windows and Linux. \n\n#### Python\n\nYFPY requires Python 3.8 or later, and has been tested through Python 3.11.\n\n#### Development\n\nDirect project dependencies can be viewed in `requirements.txt`, and additional development and build dependencies (*not* including transitive dependencies) can be viewed in `requirements-dev.txt`.\n\n---\n\n<a name=\"troubleshooting\"></a>\n### Troubleshooting\n\n#### Yahoo Fantasy Sports API\n\nOccasionally when you use the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API, there are hangups on the other end that can cause data not to transmit, and you might encounter an error similar to this:\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"yfpy-app.py\", line 114, in <module>\n    var = app.run()\n  File \"/Users/your_username/PATH/T0/LOCAL/PROJECT/yfpy-app.py\", line 429, in run\n    for team in team_standings:\nIndexError: list index out of range\n```\n\nTypically, when the above error (or a similar error) occurs, it simply means that one of the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API calls failed and so no data was retrieved. This can be fixed by simply re-running data query.\n"

([example](https://github.com/Drarig29/brackets-viewer.js/blob/ed31fc4fc43336d3543411f802a8b1d9d592d467/demo/with-api.html#L46-L52), [feature request](https://github.com/Drarig29/brackets-viewer.js/discussions/93))\n\n![Screenshot](screenshot.png)\n\n## How to use?\n\nImport the library from npm using [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) (you can replace `@latest` to lock a specific version):\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/brackets-viewer@latest/dist/brackets-viewer.min.css\" />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/brackets-viewer@latest/dist/brackets-viewer.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nOr from GitHub with (you can replace `@master` by any branch name, tag name or commit id):\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Drarig29/brackets-viewer.js@master/dist/brackets-viewer.min.css\" />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Drarig29/brackets-viewer.js@master/dist/brackets-viewer.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nNow, you can use it with data generated using [brackets-manager](https://github.com/Drarig29/brackets-manager.js) or with crafted data following the [brackets-model](https://github.com/Drarig29/brackets-model).\n\n**Usage:**\n\nThis will find a **unique** element with a `.brackets-viewer` class, and **append** to it:\n\n```js\nwindow.bracketsViewer.render({\n  stages: data.stage,\n  matches: data.match,\n  matchGames: data.match_game,\n  participants: data.participant,\n});\n```\n\nIf you want to clear the container's content before rendering again, use this:\n\n```js\nwindow.bracketsViewer.render({\n  stages: data.stage,\n  matches: data.match,\n  matchGames: data.match_game,\n  participants: data.participant,\n}, {\n  clear: true,\n});\n```\n\nIf you have multiple elements with a `.brackets-viewer` class, you must provide a `selector`:\n\n```js\nwindow.bracketsViewer.render({\n  stages: data.stage,\n  matches: data.match,\n  matchGames: data.match_game,\n  participants: data.participant,\n}, {\n  selector: '#example',\n});\n```\n\nSee the [full documentation](https://drarig29.github.io/brackets-docs/reference/viewer/interfaces/Config.html) for the `render()` configuration.\n\n## Demos\n\nTo quickly test, you can also try the demos by visiting `./demo/index.html`.\n\nTo use `json-server`, you can:\n\n- Run the npm script named `db` to serve the static database file `./demo/db.json`\n\n  ```bash\n  npm run db\n  ```\n\n- Or use directly the `db.json` file generated by unit tests in the `brackets-manager` project\n\n  ```bash\n  npx json-server --watch path/to/brackets-manager/db.json\n  ```\n\n## Credits\n\nThis library has been created to be used by the [Nantarena](https://nantarena.net/).\n\nIt has been inspired by:\n\n- [Toornament](https://www.toornament.com/en_US/) (design inspiration)\n- [Responsive Tournament Bracket](https://codepen.io/jimmyhayek/full/yJkdEB) (connection between matches in plain CSS)\n"

        "readme_contents": ".. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/hockey-scraper.svg\n   :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/hockey-scraper\n.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/hockey-scraper/badge/?version=latest\n   :target: https://readthedocs.org/projects/hockey-scraper/?badge=latest\n   :alt: Documentation Status\n\n\nHockey-Scraper\n==============\n\n.. inclusion-marker-for-sphinx\n\n\nPurpose\n-------\n\nScrape NHL data off the NHL API and website. This includes the Play by Play and Shift data for each game and the schedule information. \nIt currently supports all preseason, regular season, and playoff games from the 2007-2008 season onwards. \n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\n\nYou are going to need to have python installed for this. This should work for both python 2.7 and 3. I recommend having\nfrom at least version 3.6.0 but earlier versions should be fine.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install all you need to do is open up your terminal and run:\n\n::\n\n    pip install hockey_scraper\n\n\nNHL Usage\n---------\n\nThe full documentation can be found `here <http://hockey-scraper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.\n\nStandard Scrape Functions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nScrape data on a season by season level:\n\n::\n\n    import hockey_scraper\n\n    # Scrapes the 2015 & 2016 season with shifts and stores the data in a Csv file\n    hockey_scraper.scrape_seasons([2015, 2016], True)\n\n    # Scrapes the 2008 season without shifts and returns a dictionary containing the pbp Pandas DataFrame\n    scraped_data = hockey_scraper.scrape_seasons([2008], False, data_format='Pandas')\n\nScrape a list of games:\n\n::\n\n    import hockey_scraper\n\n    # Scrapes the first game of 2014, 2015, and 2016 seasons with shifts and stores the data in a Csv file\n    hockey_scraper.scrape_games([2014020001, 2015020001, 2016020001], True)\n\n    # Scrapes the first game of 2007, 2008, and 2009 seasons with shifts and returns a Dictionary with the Pandas DataFrames\n    scraped_data = hockey_scraper.scrape_games([2007020001, 2008020001, 2009020001], True, data_format='Pandas')\n\nScrape all games in a given date range:\n\n::\n\n    import hockey_scraper\n\n    # Scrapes all games between 2016-10-10 and 2016-10-20 without shifts and stores the data in a Csv file\n    hockey_scraper.scrape_date_range('2016-10-10', '2016-10-20', False)\n\n    # Scrapes all games between 2015-1-1 and 2015-1-15 without shifts and returns a Dictionary with the pbp Pandas DataFrame\n    scraped_data = hockey_scraper.scrape_date_range('2015-1-1', '2015-1-15', False, data_format='Pandas')\n\n\nThe dictionary returned by setting the default argument \"data_format\" equal to \"Pandas\" is structured like:\n\n::\n\n    {\n      # Both of these are always included\n      'pbp': pbp_df,\n\n      # This is only included when the argument 'if_scrape_shifts' is set equal to True\n      'shifts': shifts_df\n    }\n\n\nSchedule\n~~~~~~~~\n\nThe schedule for any past or future games can be scraped as follows:\n\n::\n\n    import hockey_scraper\n\n    # As oppossed to the other calls the default format is 'Pandas' which returns a DataFrame\n    sched_df = hockey_scraper.scrape_schedule(\"2019-10-01\", \"2020-07-01\")\n\nThe columns returned are: `['game_id', 'date', 'venue', 'home_team', 'away_team', 'start_time', 'home_score', 'away_score', 'status']`\n\n\nPersistent Data\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAll the raw game data files retrieved can also be saved to your disk. This allows for faster rescraping (we don't need to re-retrieve them) \nand the ability to parse the data yourself.\n\nThis is achieved by setting the keyword argument `docs_dir=True`. This will store the data in a directory called `~/hockey_scraper_data`. \nYou can provide your own directory where you want everything to be stored (it must exist beforehand). By default `docs_dir=False`.\n\nFor example, let's say we are scraping the JSON PBP data for game `2019020001 <http://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/2019020001/feed/live>`_. \nIf `docs_dir` isn't `False` it will first check if the data is already in the directory. If so, it will load in the data from that file and not make a GET \nrequest to the NHL API. However if it doesn't exist, it will make a GET request and then save the output to the directory. \nThis will ensure that next time you are requesting that data it can load it from a file.\n\nHere are some examples.\n\nThe default saving location is `~/hockey_scraper_data`.\n\n\n::\n\n    # Create or try to refer to a directory in the home directory\n    # Will create a directory called 'hockey_scraper_data' in the home directory (if it doesn't exist)\n    hockey_scraper.scrape_seasons([2015, 2016], True, docs_dir=True)\n\n\nUser defined directory\n\n::\n\n    USER_PATH = \"/....\"\n    hockey_scraper.scrape_seasons([2015, 2016], True, docs_dir=USER_PATH)\n\n\nYou can override the existing files by specifying `rescrape=True`. It will retrieve all the files from source and save the newer versions to `docs_dir`.\n\n::\n\n    hockey_scraper.scrape_seasons([2015, 2016], True, docs_dir=USER_PATH, rescrape=True)\n\n\n\nLive Scraping\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHere is a simple example of a way to setup live scraping. I strongly suggest checking out\n`this section <https://hockey-scraper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/live_scrape.html>`_ of the docs if you plan on using this.\n::\n\n   import hockey_scraper as hs\n\n\n   def to_csv(game):\n       \"\"\"\n       Store each game DataFrame in a file\n\n       :param game: LiveGame object\n\n       :return: None\n       \"\"\"\n\n       # If the game:\n       # 1.

For example, there is nothing along the lines of https://bet365.com/basketball/futures/nba/mvp as a way to get to the market for the NBA's Most Valuable Player. So instead, using Selenium we navigate there in Firefox from the home page.\n\n## How to use\n\nThe script uses geckodriver for Selenium. The path it expects to find it is 'C:\\Program Files\\geckodriver\\geckodriver.exe'.\n\nRun the SeleniumScraper.py file with three parameters (each exactly as they appear on the site):\n1) The sport (e.g. \"Basketball\")\n2) The market (e.g. \"NBA Futures 2018/19\")\n3) The particular bet (e.g. \"Regular Season MVP\")\n\nSo for example,\n``` python SeleniumScraper.py \"Basketball\" \"NBA Futures 2018/19\" \"Regular Season MVP\" ```\n"

        "readme_contents": "The CRG ScoreBoard is a browser-based scoreboard solution that also provides overlays for video production and the ability to track full game data and export it to a WFTDA statsbook.\n\nThe topics on the [Scoreboard Wiki Main Page](https://github.com/rollerderby/scoreboard/wiki/) are the primary documentation for the scoreboard. In order to reach out to the developers, it's best to use the [Github Issues Page](https://github.com/rollerderby/scoreboard/issues).\n\nA mailing list and wiki were available on SourceForge (the original location for this project) but they are not currently used. Subscribing to the SourceForge mailing list and consulting the wiki there is not recommended.\n\n# Installing the Scoreboard Software\n\nThese are instructions for getting the software installed and running on a standalone computer to provide a functioning scoreboard. If you have already done this, see [Setting up the Scoreboard](#setting-up-the-scoreboard) below.\n\n## Hardware Requirements\n\nMost Apple or Windows computers that have been manufactured in the last ten years should be able to handle the scoreboard well on a standalone setup. In general, a machine with at least a dual-core 64-bit processor and 2 gigabytes of RAM should be sufficient. Using the scoreboard to provide video overlays or in a networked setup that includes penalty or lineup tracking typically requires more computing power.\n\nChromebooks that have been modified to run Linux distributions have been used to host the scoreboard but hardware limitations (lack of a suitable display output or low-powered CPUs) may cause issues.\n\n## Software Requirements\n\nThe scoreboard should be unzipped into a folder on the local machine. The user running the software requires write access to this folder. Do not put the scoreboard in a folder that requires administrator privileges to write to unless you intend to run the software as an administrator.\n\n### Web Browser\n\n[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/) (as well as their open-source parent [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/) or other browsers derived from it) are recommended for running the software. Some known issues may occur when using Mozilla Firefox or Apple Safari. Microsoft Internet Explorer is not recommended.\n\n### Java\n\nJava is required for providing a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8.0 or newer. Installing the latest version of Oracle's Java is recommended.\n\n- Windows users can install the standard Java for Windows package that is available when clicking on Free Java Download from [Oracle\u2019s Java site](https://java.com/).\n\n- Apple users must install the complete [Java Platform (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), which includes the JRE, to run the scoreboard properly.\n\n- Linux users may already have a JRE from the OpenJDK project installed, if not, OpenJDK can be obtained from [their repositories](http://openjdk.java.net/install/).\n\n## Downloading the Scoreboard\n\nThe project is currently hosted on GitHub, and ZIP files can be downloaded from the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/rollerderby/scoreboard/releases). It is recommended that you use the version labeled \"Latest release\" (green box). The \"Pre-release\" (orange box) versions are currently in development and testing, and are not recommended for sanctioned games or tournaments.\n\nPlease note that an older version of the project is still hosted on SourceForge and it is no longer maintained there.\n\n## Setting up the Scoreboard\n\nOnce Chrome and Java are installed, use your file manager to navigate to the scoreboard folder and run the scoreboard background script by double-clicking on it.\n\n- Windows users: Run scoreboard-Windows.exe to start the script.\n\n- Apple users: Run scoreboard.sh to start the script. (If clicking doesn't work, try pressing command+i (or right click on the file and select \"Get info\"). In the new info dialog in section \"open with\" select Terminal.app. (If it's not listed, choose other and navigate to /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app.)\n\n- Linux users: Run scoreboard.sh to start the script. If you are unable to start it, you may have to allow script files to be executable as programs.\n\nOnce it starts successfully, the scoreboard script will open a new window and display a series of status messages. You must keep this script running in order for the scoreboard to function, so do not close the window. You may minimize the window without effect.\n\nIn your file manager, open start.html with the recommended browser. You may need to right-click on the file and choose the **Open With** option. The browser will open to localhost:8000 where several options are presented.\n\nAssuming that your scoreboard computer is set up with a monitor/laptop screen as a primary display for the operator, and a separate projector as a second display, right-click on the second link for **Main Scoreboard** and choose **Open link in new window**. Drag the new window with the main scoreboard onto the second display, click inside the window, and press the F11 key to make the window full screen. In the first browser window that you opened on the primary display, click on one of the documentation links. It will open in a new tab. Back in the original tab click on **Main Operator Control Panel**.\n\nWhen the control panel displays, it will ask you for an operator name. Enter your name and click Login. This operator name is used to store your personalized settings such as key controls.\n\nNow you can go to the tab with the documentation and either go to the Quick Start Guide or dive in deep right away and proceed with the section on the Controls page.\n"

F stands for FanDuel, D stands for DraftKings, and W stands for William Hill.\n- Programs that end with \"Two Person\" are for two person or two team events that include only moneyline bets (such as tennis).\n- Programs that do not end with this phrase are for sports that include over / under bets, moneyline and spread bets (such as baseball).\n- The automated bot only looks for standard bet types.\n\nThe program will first scrape all live event names and odds based on the sport selected in the program. The live event names are matched against each sportsbook in order to compare live odds. Using a Nash equilibrium, the program will find if there are arbitrage betting opportunities. If an arbitrage is found, then the program will select that wager, enter the calculated wager amounts and place the bet.\n\nThe programs use multithreading to make them as fast as possible to find arbitrage opportunities. Also, the programs use the [undetected-chromedriver](https://pypi.org/project/undetected-chromedriver/) package to help avoid bot detection.\n\n**Please note** that most sportsbooks include a bet delay. After a bet is placed, the sportsbook will take several seconds to validate the bet. During this time, one sportsbook may accept your bet, while the other sportsbook may update its odds.\n\n## Troubleshooting Error\n\nIf you run into an error that states `AttributeError: 'ArbFinder' object has no attribute 'driver'` go to `chrome://settings/help` in your URL bar. There may be a relaunch option where your Chrome version is. Otherwise, try to upgrade your Chrome version. Your Chrome version may be different from the ChromeDriver version downloaded by the program.\n\n## Personalizing the programs\n\nUpdate this section of the code if you want to bet on a different sport:\n\n```\nself.sport = 'Baseball'\n```\n\nUpdate these sections of the code if you want to change your bet amount, lower & upper arbitrage return limit and max odd limit:\n\n```\nself.main_bet_amount = 100  # Total amount to wager. The program will split the two bets, so that the total wager is this amount\nself.lower_limit = 0.000  # Lower arbritage limit to bet on, as a percentage\nself.upper_limit = 0.070  # Upper arbritage limit to bet on, as a percentage (0.070 = 7%)\nself.bet_limit = 0.10  # Most websites require a minimum of $0.10 a wager on each bet\nself.odds_limit = 750  # The program will not wager above these odds (i.e. +750)\n```\n\nMost references state that wagers should be rounded to the dollar to help avoid arbitrage detection. Update the round function below to zero decimal places if you need:\n\n```\nself.result = [round(x, 2) for x in self.result]\n```\n\nSubmitting a wager has been commented out in the programs. You can submit a wager by uncommenting this section of code:\n\n```\nself.pool.apply_async(self.process, args=(9, 0, 0, 0,))\nself.pool.apply_async(self.process, args=(10, 0, 0, 0,))\n# Join the pools so they run in parallel\nself.pool.join()\n```\n\n## Additional information about the programs\n\nThe programs use the naming convention \"bid\" and \"ask.\" I built the programs from a framework that traded binary options and did not update the naming convention. \"Bid\" means DraftKings or William Hill, while \"ask\" means FanDuel.\n"

Details below\n\n-The Gambler Problem as discussed in Example 4.3 in Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.\n-The problem from the book is described below:\n\n**Gambler\u2019s Problem**: A gambler has the opportunity to make bets\non the outcomes of a sequence of coin flips. If the coin comes up heads, he wins as\nmany dollars as he has staked on that flip; if it is tails, he loses his stake. The game\nends when the gambler wins by reaching his goal of $100, or loses by running out of\nmoney. On each flip, the gambler must decide what portion of his capital to stake,\nin integer numbers of dollars. This problem can be formulated as an undiscounted,\nepisodic, finite MDP. The state is the gambler\u2019s capital, s \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , 99} and the\nactions are stakes, a \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , min(s, 100\u2212s)}. The reward is zero on all transitions\nexcept those on which the gambler reaches his goal, when it is +1. The state-value\nfunction then gives the probability of winning from each state. A policy is a mapping\nfrom levels of capital to stakes. The optimal policy maximizes the probability of\nreaching the goal. Let ph denote the probability of the coin coming up heads. If ph\nis known, then the entire problem is known and it can be solved, for instance, by\nvalue iteration\n"

Our work is capable of simultaneously capturing 3D human motions and understanding fine-grained actions from monocular challenging sports video input.<br>\n<p float=\"left\">\n  <img src=\"./README/teaser.png\" width=\"800\" />\n</p>\n\n## Abstract\nMarkerless motion capture and understanding of professional non-daily human movements is an important yet unsolved task, which suffers from complex motion patterns and severe self-occlusion, especially for the monocular setting. In this paper, we propose SportsCap -- the first approach for simultaneously capturing 3D human motions and understanding fine-grained actions from monocular challenging sports video input. Our approach utilizes the semantic and temporally structured sub-motion prior in the embedding space for motion capture and understanding in a data-driven multi-task manner. Comprehensive experiments on both public and our proposed datasets show that with a challenging monocular sports video input, our novel approach not only significantly improves the accuracy of 3D human motion capture, but also recovers accurate fine-grained semantic action attributes.\n\n[comment]: <To enable robust capture under complex motion patterns, we propose an effective motion embedding module to recover both the implicit motion embedding and explicit 3D motion details via a corresponding mapping function as well as a sub-motion classifier. Based on such hybrid motion information, we introduce a multi-stream spatial-temporal Graph Convolutional Network(ST-GCN) to predict the fine-grained semantic action attributes, and adopt a semantic attribute mapping block to assemble various correlated action attributes into a high-level action label for the overall detailed understanding of the whole sequence, so as to enable various applications like action assessment or motion scoring.> \n\n## Licenses\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/80x15.png\" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.\n\nAll material is made available under [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode) license.

It aims to provide a free tool to obtain research-grade results from consumer-grade equipment. Any combination of phone, webcam, gopro, etc can be used.\n\nPose2Sim stands for \"OpenPose to OpenSim\", as it uses OpenPose inputs (2D keypoints coordinates obtained from multiple videos) and leads to an OpenSim result (full-body 3D joint angles). Other 2D pose estimators can alternatively be used as inputs.\n\nIf you can only use one single camera and don't mind losing some accuracy, please consider using [Sports2D](https://github.com/davidpagnon/Sports2D).\n\n\n<img src=\"Content/Pose2Sim_workflow.jpg\" width=\"760\">\n\n<img src='Content/Activities_verylow.gif' title='Other more or less challenging tasks and conditions.' width=\"760\">\n\n# Contents\n1.

Has to be compiled from source on Linux (see [there](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Linux+Support)).*\n3. ***Optional.*** *Install Anaconda or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). \\\n   Open an Anaconda terminal and create a virtual environment with typing:*\n   <pre><i>conda create -n Pose2Sim python=3.8 -y \n   conda activate Pose2Sim</i></pre>\n   \n3. **Install Pose2Sim**:\\\nIf you don't use Anaconda, type `python -V` in terminal to make sure python>=3.8 is installed.\n   - OPTION 1: **Quick install:** Open a terminal. \n       ``` cmd\n       pip install pose2sim\n       ```\n     \n   - OPTION 2: **Build from source and test the last changes:**\n     Open a terminal in the directory of your choice and Clone the Pose2Sim repository.\n       ``` cmd\n       git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim.git\n       cd pose2sim\n       pip install .\n       ```\n          \n## Demonstration Part-1: Build 3D TRC file on Python  \n> _**This demonstration provides an example experiment of a person balancing on a beam, filmed with 4 calibrated cameras processed with OpenPose.**_ \n\nOpen a terminal, enter `pip show pose2sim`, report package location. \\\nCopy this path and go to the Demo folder with `cd <path>\\pose2sim\\Demo`. \\\nType `ipython`, and test the following code:\n``` python\nfrom Pose2Sim import Pose2Sim\nPose2Sim.calibration()\nPose2Sim.personAssociation()\nPose2Sim.triangulation()\nPose2Sim.filtering()\n```\nYou should obtain a plot of all the 3D coordinates trajectories. You can check the logs in`Demo\\Users\\logs.txt`.\\\nResults are stored as .trc files in the `Demo/pose-3d` directory.\n\n*N.B.:* Default parameters have been provided in [Demo\\User\\Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Demo/User/Config.toml) but can be edited.\\\n*N.B.:* *Try calibration tool by changing `calibration_type` to `calculate` instead of `convert` (more info [there](#calculate-from-scratch)).*\n<br/>\n\n## Demonstration Part-2: Obtain 3D joint angles with OpenSim  \n> _**In the same vein as you would do with marker-based kinematics, start with scaling your model, and then perform inverse kinematics.**_ \n\n### Scaling\n1. Open OpenSim.\n2. Open the provided `Model_Pose2Sim_Body25b.osim` model from `pose2sim/Demo/opensim`. *(File -> Open Model)*\n3. Load the provided `Scaling_Setup_Pose2Sim_Body25b.xml` scaling file from `pose2sim/Demo/opensim`. *(Tools -> Scale model -> Load)*\n4. Run. You should see your skeletal model take the static pose.\n\n### Inverse kinematics\n1. Load the provided `IK_Setup_Pose2Sim_Body25b.xml` scaling file from `pose2sim/Demo/opensim`. *(Tools -> Inverse kinematics -> Load)*\n2. Run. You should see your skeletal model move in the Vizualizer window.\n<br/>\n\n# Use on your own data\n\n> _**Deeper explanations and instructions are given below.**_\n\n## Prepare for running on your own data\n  > _**Get ready.**_\n  \n  1. Find your `Pose2Sim\\Empty_project`, copy-paste it where you like and give it the name of your choice.\n  2. Edit the [User\\Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Empty_project/User/Config.toml) file as needed, **especially regarding the path to your project**. \n  3.

Consequently, we recommend using this 2D pose estimation solution. See [OpenPose repository](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) for installation and running.\n* Open a command prompt in your **OpenPose** directory. \\\n  Launch OpenPose for each raw image folder: \n  ``` cmd\n  bin\\OpenPoseDemo.exe --model_pose BODY_25B --video <PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR>\\raw-2d\\vid_cam1.mp4 --write_json <PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR>\\pose-2d\\pose_cam1_json\n  ```\n* The [BODY_25B model](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_train/tree/master/experimental_models) has more accurate results than the standard BODY_25 one and has been extensively tested for Pose2Sim. \\\nYou can also use the [BODY_135 model](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_train/tree/master/experimental_models), which allows for the evaluation of pronation/supination, wrist flexion, and wrist deviation.\\\nAll other OpenPose models (BODY_25, COCO, MPII) are also supported.\\\nMake sure you modify the [User\\Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Empty_project/User/Config.toml) file accordingly.\n* Use one of the `json_display_with_img.py` or `json_display_with_img.py` scripts (see [Utilities](#utilities)) if you want to display 2D pose detections.\n\n**N.B.:** *OpenPose BODY_25B is the default 2D pose estimation model used in Pose2Sim. However, other skeleton models from other 2D pose estimation solutions can be used alternatively.* \\\n    - You will first need to convert your 2D detection files to the OpenPose format (see [Utilities](#utilities)). \\\n    - Then, change the `pose_model` in the [User\\Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Empty_project/User/Config.toml) file. You may also need to choose a different `tracked_keypoint` if the Neck is not detected by the chosen model. \\\n    - Finally, use the corresponding OpenSim model and setup files, which are provided in the `Empty_project\\opensim` folder. \n  \n Available models are:    \n    - OpenPose BODY_25B, BODY_25, BODY_135, COCO, MPII \\\n    - Mediapipe BLAZEPOSE \\\n    - DEEPLABCUT \\\n    - AlphaPose HALPE_26, HALPE_68, HALPE_136, COCO_133, COCO, MPII\n\n### With MediaPipe:\n[Mediapipe BlazePose](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/pose.html) is very fast, fully runs under Python, handles upside-down postures and wrist movements (but no subtalar ankle angles). \\\nHowever, it is less robust and accurate than OpenPose, and can only detect a single person.\n* Use the script `Blazepose_runsave.py` (see [Utilities](#utilities)) to run BlazePose under Python, and store the detected coordinates in OpenPose (json) or DeepLabCut (h5 or csv) format: \n  ``` cmd\n  python -m Blazepose_runsave -i rinput_file -dJs\n  ```\n  Type in `python -m Blazepose_runsave -h` for explanation on parameters and for additional ones.\n* Make sure you change the `pose_model` and the `tracked_keypoint` in the [User\\Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Empty_project/User/Config.toml) file.\n\n### With DeepLabCut:\nIf you need to detect specific points on a human being, an animal, or an object, you can also train your own model with [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut).\n1. Train your DeepLabCut model and run it on your images or videos (more instruction on their repository)\n2. Translate the h5 2D coordinates to json files (with `DLC_to_OpenPose.py` script, see [Utilities](#utilities)): \n   ``` cmd\n   python -m DLC_to_OpenPose -i rinput_h5_file\n   ```\n3. Report the model keypoints in the [skeleton.py](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/skeletons.py) file, and make sure you change the `pose_model` and the `tracked_keypoint` in the [User\\Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Empty_project/User/Config.toml) file.\n4. Create an OpenSim model if you need 3D joint angles.\n\n### With AlphaPose:\n[AlphaPose](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose) is one of the main competitors of OpenPose, and its accuracy is comparable. As a top-down approach (unlike OpenPose which is bottom-up), it is faster on single-person detection, but slower on multi-person detection.\n* Install and run AlphaPose on your videos (more instruction on their repository)\n* Translate the AlphaPose single json file to OpenPose frame-by-frame files (with `AlphaPose_to_OpenPose.py` script, see [Utilities](#utilities)): \n   ``` cmd\n   python -m AlphaPose_to_OpenPose -i input_alphapose_json_file\n   ```\n* Make sure you change the `pose_model` and the `tracked_keypoint` in the [User\\Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Empty_project/User/Config.toml) file.\n\n<img src=\"Content/Pose2D.png\" width=\"760\">\n\nN.B.: Markers are not needed in Pose2Sim and were used here for validation\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>The project hierarchy becomes: (CLICK TO SHOW)</summary>\n    <pre>\n   Project\n   \u2502\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500opensim\n   \u2502    \u251c\u2500\u2500Geometry\n   \u2502    \u251c\u2500\u2500Model_Pose2Sim_Body25b.osim\n   \u2502    \u251c\u2500\u2500Scaling_Setup_Pose2Sim_Body25b.xml\n   \u2502    \u2514\u2500\u2500IK_Setup_Pose2Sim_Body25b.xml\n   \u2502\n   <i><b>\u251c\u2500\u2500pose-2d\n   \u2502    \u251c\u2500\u2500pose_cam1_json\n   \u2502    \u251c\u2500\u2500...\n   \u2502    \u2514\u2500\u2500pose_camN_json</i></b>\n   \u2502        \n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 raw-2d\n   \u2502    \u251c\u2500\u2500vid_cam1.mp4\n   \u2502    \u251c\u2500\u2500...\n   \u2502    \u2514\u2500\u2500vid_camN.mp4\n   \u2502\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500User\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500Config.toml\n   </pre>\n</details>\n\n## Camera calibration\n> _**Convert a preexisting calibration file, or calculate intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from scratch.**_ \\\n> _**N.B.:**_ You can visualize camera calibration in 3D with my (experimental) [Maya-Mocap tool](https://github.com/davidpagnon/Maya-Mocap). \n\nOpen an Anaconda prompt or a terminal, type `ipython`.\\\nBy default, `calibration()` will look for `Config.toml` in the `User` folder of your current directory. If you want to store it somewhere else (e.g. in your data directory), specify this path as an argument: `Pose2Sim.calibration(r'path_to_config.toml')`.\n\n``` python\nfrom Pose2Sim import Pose2Sim\nPose2Sim.calibration()\n```\n\nOutput:\\\n<img src=\"Content/Calib2D.png\" width=\"760\">\n<img src=\"Content/CalibFile.png\" width=\"760\">\n\n### Convert from Qualisys, Optitrack, Vicon, OpenCap, EasyMocap, or bioCV\n      \nIf you already have a calibration file, set `calibration_type` type to `convert` in your [User\\Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Empty_project/User/Config.toml) file.\n- **From [Qualisys](https://www.qualisys.com):**\n  - Export calibration to `.qca.txt` within QTM.\n  - Copy it in the `calibration` Pose2Sim folder.\n  - set `convert_from` to 'qualisys' in your [User\\Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Empty_project/User/Config.toml) file. Change `binning_factor` to 2 if you film in 540p.\n- **From [Optitrack](https://optitrack.com/):** Exporting calibration will be available in Motive 3.2. In the meantime:\n  - Calculate intrinsics with a board (see next section).\n  - Use their C++ API [to retrieve extrinsic properties](https://docs.optitrack.com/developer-tools/motive-api/motive-api-function-reference#tt_cameraxlocation). Translation can be copied as is in your `Calib.toml` file, but TT_CameraOrientationMatrix first needs to be [converted to a Rodrigues vector](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html#ga61585db663d9da06b68e70cfbf6a1eac) with OpenCV. See instructions [here](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/issues/28).\n- **From [Vicon](http://www.vicon.com/Software/Nexus):**  \n  - Copy your `.xcp` Vicon calibration file to the Pose2Sim `calibration` folder.\n  - set `convert_from` to 'vicon' in your [User\\Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Empty_project/User/Config.toml) file. No other setting is needed.\n- **From [OpenCap](https://www.opencap.ai/):**  \n  - Copy your `.pickle` OpenCap calibration files to the Pose2Sim `calibration` folder.\n  - set `convert_from` to 'opencap' in your [User\\Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Empty_project/User/Config.toml) file. No other setting is needed.\n- **From [EasyMocap](https://github.com/zju3dv/EasyMocap/):**  \n  - Copy your `intri.yml` and `extri.yml` files to the Pose2Sim `calibration` folder.\n  - set `convert_from` to 'easymocap' in your [User\\Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Empty_project/User/Config.toml) file. No other setting is needed.\n- **From [bioCV](https://github.com/camera-mc-dev/.github/blob/main/profile/mocapPipe.md):**  \n  - Copy your bioCV calibration files (no extension) to the Pose2Sim `calibration` folder.\n  - set `convert_from` to 'biocv' in your [User\\Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Empty_project/User/Config.toml) file. No other setting is needed.\n\n\n### Calculate from scratch\n\n> Calculate calibration parameters with a board, or with points (such as detected on a wand or a human body).\n\n- **With a board:**\n  > *N.B.:* Try the calibration tool on the Demo by changing `calibration_type` to `calculate` in [User\\Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Empty_project/User/Config.toml).\\\n  For the sake of practicality, there are voluntarily few board images for intrinsic calibration, and few points to click for extrinsic calibration. In spite of this, your reprojection error should be under 1-2 cm, which [does not hinder the quality of kinematic results in practice](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/19/6530/htm#:~:text=Angle%20results%20were,Table%203).).\n  \n  - **Calculate intrinsic parameters:**\n\n    > *N.B.:* _Intrinsic parameters:_ camera properties (focal length, optical center, distortion), usually need to be calculated only once in their lifetime. In theory, cameras with same model and same settings will have identical intrinsic parameters.\\\n    > *N.B.:* If you already calculated intrinsic parameters earlier, you can skip this step. Copy your intrinsic parameters (`size`, `mat`, and `dist`) in a new `Calib*.toml` file, and set `overwrite_intrinsics` to false.

Load the provided `Scaling_Setup_Pose2Sim_Body25b.xml` scaling file from `pose2sim/Empty_project/opensim`. *(Tools -> Scale model -> Load)*\n5. Replace the example static .trc file with your own data.\n6. Run\n7. Save the new scaled OpenSim model.\n\n### OpenSim Inverse kinematics\n1. Use Pose2Sim to generate 3D trajectories.\n2. Open OpenSim.\n3. Load the provided `IK_Setup_Pose2Sim_Body25b.xml` scaling file from `pose2sim/Empty_project/opensim`. *(Tools -> Inverse kinematics -> Load)*\n4. Replace the example .trc file with your own data, and specify the path to your angle kinematics output file.\n5. Run\n6. Motion results will appear as .mot file in the `pose2sim/Empty_project/opensim` directory (automatically saved).\n\n<img src=\"Content/OpenSim.JPG\" width=\"380\">\n\n\n### Command line\nAlternatively, you can use command-line tools:\n\n- Open an Anaconda terminal in your OpenSim/bin directory, typically `C:\\OpenSim <Version>\\bin`.\\\n  You'll need to adjust the `time_range`, `output_motion_file`, and enter the full paths to the input and output `.osim`, `.trc`, and `.mot` files in your setup file.\n  ``` cmd\n  opensim-cmd run-tool <PATH TO YOUR SCALING OR IK SETUP FILE>.xml\n  ```\n\n- You can also run OpenSim directly in Python:\n  ``` python\n  import subprocess\n  subprocess.call([\"opensim-cmd\", \"run-tool\", r\"<PATH TO YOUR SCALING OR IK SETUP FILE>.xml\"])\n  ```\n\n- Or take advantage of the full the OpenSim Python API. See [there](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Scripting+in+Python) for installation instructions (conda install may take a while).\\\nMake sure to replace `py38np120` with your Python version (3.8 in this case) and with your numpy version (1.20 here).\n  ``` cmd\n  conda install -c opensim-org opensim-moco=4.4=py38np120 -y\n  ```\n  If you run into a DLL error while importing opensim, open the file `<Pose2Sim-env>\\Lib\\opensim\\__init__.py` and replace `conda`by `conda-meta` line 4. `<Pose2Sim-env>` location can be found with `conda env list`.\\\n  Then run: \n  `ipython`\n  ``` python\n  import opensim\n  opensim.ScaleTool(\"<PATH TO YOUR SCALING OR IK SETUP FILE>.xml\").run()\n  opensim.InverseKinematicsTool(\"<PATH TO YOUR SCALING OR IK SETUP FILE>.xml\").run()\n  ```\n  You can also run other API commands.

Cf [this draft script](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/draft/Pose2Sim/Utilities/synchronize_cams.py).\n\n&#10004; **Person Association:** Automatically choose the main person to triangulate.\n&#9634; **Person Association:** Multiple persons association. 1. Triangulate all the persons whose reprojection error is below a certain threshold (instead of only the one with minimum error), and then track in time with speed cf [Slembrouck 2020](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-40605-9_15)? or 2.

Triangulate all persons with reprojection error above threshold, and identify them by minimizing their displacement across frames.\n&#9634; **Triangulation:** Offer the possibility of triangulating with Sparse Bundle Adjustment (SBA), Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Full Trajectory Estimation (FTE) (see [AcinoSet](https://github.com/African-Robotics-Unit/AcinoSet)).\n&#9634; **Triangulation:** Solve limb swapping (although not really an issue with Body_25b). Try triangulating with opposite side if reprojection error too large. Alternatively, ignore right and left sides, use RANSAC or SDS triangulation, and then choose right or left by majority voting. More confidence can be given to cameras whose plane is the most coplanar to the right/left line.\n&#9634; **Triangulation:** Implement normalized DLT and RANSAC triangulation, Outlier rejection (sliding z-score?), as well as a [triangulation refinement step](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2022.3171102).\n\n&#10004; **Filtering:** Available filtering methods: Butterworth, Butterworth on speed, Gaussian, Median, LOESS (polynomial smoothing).\n&#10004; **Filtering:** Implement Kalman filter and Kalman smoother.\n&#9634; **Filtering:** Implement [smoothNet](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/issues/29)\n\n&#10004; **OpenSim:** Integrate better spine from [lifting fullbody model](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30714401) to the [gait full-body model](https://nmbl.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/07505900.pdf), more accurate for the knee.\n&#10004; **OpenSim:** Optimize model marker positions as compared to ground-truth marker-based positions.\n&#10004; **OpenSim:** Add scaling and inverse kinematics setup files.\n&#10004; **OpenSim:** Add full model with contact spheres ([SmoothSphereHalfSpaceForce](https://simtk.org/api_docs/opensim/api_docs/classOpenSim_1_1SmoothSphereHalfSpaceForce.html#details)) and full-body muscles ([DeGrooteFregly2016Muscle](https://simtk.org/api_docs/opensim/api_docs/classOpenSim_1_1DeGrooteFregly2016Muscle.html#details)), for [Moco](https://opensim-org.github.io/opensim-moco-site/) for example.\n&#9634; **OpenSim:** Implement optimal fixed-interval Kalman smoothing for inverse kinematics ([this OpenSim fork](https://github.com/antoinefalisse/opensim-core/blob/kalman_smoother/OpenSim/Tools/InverseKinematicsKSTool.cpp)), or [Biorbd](https://github.com/pyomeca/biorbd/blob/f776fe02e1472aebe94a5c89f0309360b52e2cbc/src/RigidBody/KalmanReconsMarkers.cpp))\n\n&#9634; **GUI:** 3D plot of cameras and of triangulated keypoints.\n&#9634; **GUI:** Demo on Google Colab (see [Sports2D](https://bit.ly/Sports2D_Colab) for OpenPose and Python package installation on Google Drive).\n&#9634; **GUI:** Blender add-on (cf [MPP2SOS](https://blendermarket.com/products/mocap-mpp2soss)), or webapp (e.g., with [Napari](https://napari.org/stable).

The videos are [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1J3fdQxPUtkMe6i8moCXZ0A) or [Google cloud](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AAhTbNroSFsygHBXa88emCU7f50MxI8t?usp=sharing). Please rename the directory ClipShots to data.tar.gz to use data.\n\n## Introduction\nClipShots is the first large-scale dataset for shot boundary detection collected from Youtube and Weibo covering more than 20 categories, including sports, TV shows, animals, etc. In contrast to previous shot boundary detection dataset, e.g. TRECVID and RAI, which only consist of documentaries or talk shows where the frames are relatively static, we construct a database containing short videos from Youtube and Weibo. Many short videos are home-made, with more challenges, e.g. hand-held vibrations and large occlusion. The types of these videos are various, including movie spotlights, competition highlights, family videos recorded by mobile phones etc. Each video has a length of 1-20 minutes. The gradual transitions in our database include dissolve, fade in fade out, and sliding in sliding out.\n\n## Description\nThe database contains 3 sets of data, training set, testing set and 'only_gradual' set. The trainig set and the 'only_gradual' set are for training and the testing set is for evaluation. For the 'only_gradual' set, we annotate the gradual transitions because of insufficent gradual transitions in training set. In `video_lists`, there are 3 files that contain the video names of them respectively. The evaluation script is in `tools`.\n\n## Main results\nWe list some strong baselines here.\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Methods</th>\n            <th colspan=3>Cut</th>\n            <th colspan=3>Gradual</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td></td>\n            <td>Precision</td>\n            <td>Recall</td>\n            <td>F1-score</td>\n            <td>Precision</td>\n            <td>Recall</td>\n            <td>F1-score</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>deepSBD (Alexnet-like, origin)</td>\n            <td>0.731</td>\n            <td>0.921</td>\n            <td>0.815</td>\n            <td>0.837</td>\n            <td>0.386</td>\n            <td>0.528</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>deepSBD (ResNet-18)</td>\n            <td>0.765</td>\n            <td>0.910</td>\n            <td>0.831</td>\n            <td>0.770</td>\n            <td>0.622</td>\n            <td>0.688</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>DSM</td>\n            <td>0.776</td>\n            <td>0.934</td>\n            <td>0.848</td>\n            <td>0.840</td>\n            <td>0.904</td>\n            <td>0.870</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\nPlease refer to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03281.pdf) for deepSBD and [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.04234.pdf) for DSM.

In addition to the data and databases themselves, Boxball relies on the following tools:\n*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/) for repeatable builds and easy distribution\n*   [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for abstracting away DDL differences between databases\n*   [Chadwick](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/chadwick) for translating Retrosheet's complex event files into a relational format\n\nFollow the instructions below to install your distribution of choice. The full set of images is also available on\nDocker Hub.\n\nThe Retrosheet schema is extensively documented in the code; see the source [here](https://github.com/droher/boxball/blob/master/transform/src/schemas/retrosheet.py)\nuntil I find a prettier solution.\n\nIf you find the project useful, please consider donating to:\n*   The [Ali Forney Center](https://aliforneycenter.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donate.general) for homeless LGBTQ youth\n*   [350.org](https://act.350.org/donate/build/), a grassroots international climate change organization\n\nFeel free to [contact me](mailto:david@boxball.io) with questions or comments! \n\n## Requirements\n*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (v18.06, earlier versions may not work)\n*   2-20GB Disk space (depends on distribution choice)\n*   500MB-8GB RAM available to Docker (depends on distribution choice)\n\n## Distributions\n### Column-Oriented Databases\n#### Postgres cstore_fdw (Recommended)\nThis distribution uses the [cstore_fdw](https://github.com/citusdata/cstore_fdw) extension to turn PostgreSQL\ninto a column-oriented database. This means that you get the rich featureset of Postgres,\nbut with a huge improvement in speed and disk usage. To install and run the database server:\n\n`docker run --name postgres-cstore-fdw -d -p 5433:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"postgres\" -v ~/boxball/postgres-cstore-fdw:/var/lib/postgresql/data doublewick/boxball:postgres-cstore-fdw-latest`\n\nRoughly an hour after the image is downloaded, the data will be fully loaded into the database, and you can connect to it as the user `postgres`\nwith password `postgres` on port `5433`\n(either using the `psql` command line tool or a database client of your choice). The data will be persisted on your machine in\n`~/boxball/postgres-cstore-fdw` (~1.5GB), which means you can stop/remove the container without having to reload the data\nwhen you turn it back on.\n\n#### Clickhouse\n[Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.yandex/) is a database developed by Yandex with some very impressive performance benchmarks. It uses less\ndisk space than Postgres cstore_fdw, but significantly more RAM (~5GB). I've yet to run any query performance comparisons.\nTo install and run the database server:\n\n`docker run --name clickhouse -d -p 8123:8123 -v ~/boxball/clickhouse:/var/lib/clickhouse doublewick/boxball:clickhouse-latest`\n\n15-30 minutes after the image is downloaded, the data will be fully loaded into the database, and you can connect to it either by attaching the\ncontainer and using the `clickhouse-client` CLI or by using a local database client on port `8123` as the user `default`. \nThe data will be persisted on your machine in\n`~/boxball/clickhouse` (~700MB), which means you can stop/remove the container without having to reload the data\nwhen you turn it back on.\n\n#### Drill\n[Drill](https://drill.apache.org/) is a framework that allows for SQL queries directly on files, without having to declare any schema.\nIt is usually used on a computing cluster with massive datasets, but we use a single-node setup. To install and run:\n\n`docker run --name drill -id -p 8047:8047 -p 31010:31010 -v ~/boxball/drill:/data doublewick/boxball:drill-latest`\n \nData will be immediately available to query after the image is downloaded. Use port `8047` to access the Web UI \n(which includes a SQL runner) and port `31010` to connect via a database client.\nYou may also attach the container and query from the command line.\nThe data will be persisted on your machine in `~/boxball/drill` (~700MB).\n\n### Traditional (Row-oriented) Databases\nNote: these frameworks are likely to be prohibitively slow when querying play-by-play data, and they take up significantly\nmore disk space than their columnar counterparts.\n#### Postgres\nSimilar configuration to the cstore_fdw extended version above, but stored in the conventional way.\n\n`docker run --name postgres -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"postgres\" -v ~/boxball/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data doublewick/boxball:postgres-latest`\n\nRoughly 90 minutes after the image is downloaded, the data will be fully loaded into the database,\nand you can connect to it as the user `postgres` with password `postgres` on port `5432`\n(either using the `psql` command line tool or a database client of your choice). The data will be persisted on your machine in\n`~/boxball/postgres` (~12GB), which means you can stop/remove the container without having to reload the data\nwhen you turn it back on.\n\n#### MySQL\nTo install and run:\n\n`docker run --name mysql -d -p 3306:3306 -v ~/boxball/mysql:/var/lib/mysql doublewick/boxball:mysql-latest`\n\nRoughly two hours after the image is downloaded, the data will be fully loaded into the database,\nand you can connect to it as the user `root` on port `3306`. The data will be persisted on your machine in\n`~/boxball/mysql` (~12GB), which means you can stop/remove the container without having to reload the data\nwhen you turn it back on.\n\n#### SQLite (with web UI)\nTo install and run:\n\n`docker run --name sqlite -d -p 8080:8080 -v ~/boxball/sqlite:/db doublewick/boxball:sqlite-latest`\n\nRoughly two minutes after the image is downloaded, the data will be fully loaded into the database. `localhost:8080`\nwill provide a [web UI](https://github.com/coleifer/sqlite-web) where you can write queries and perform schema exploration.\n\n### Flat File Downloads\n\n#### Parquet\nParquet is a columnar data format originally developed for the Hadoop ecosystem. It has solid support in Spark, Pandas,\nand many other frameworks.\n[OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtpEocFNRNBWhAqZMaj40Bb8__6u?e=dNJiod)\n\n#### CSV\nThe original CSVs from the extract step (each CSV file is compressed in the ZSTD format).\n[OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtpEocFNRNBWhDLuZqcmXYOIieKQ?e=xP4Azs)\n\n## Acknowledgements\nTed Turocy's [Chadwick Bureau](http://chadwick-bureau.com/) developed the tools and repos that made this project possible. I am also grateful to [Sean\nLahman](http://www.seanlahman.com/) for creating his database, which I have been using for over 15 years. I was able\nto develop and host this project for free thanks to the generous open-source plans of [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=boxball), CircleCI, Github, and Docker Hub.\n\nRetrosheet represents the collective effort of thousands of baseball fans over 150 years of scorekeeping and data entry.\nI hope Boxball facilitates more historical research to continue this tradition.\n\n## Licence(s)\nAll code is released under the Apache 2.0 license.

In this project, I utilize the **Live Sports Odds API** (https://the-odds-api.com/) to find statistical arbitrage opportunities in upcoming sporting events across the world. For sports betting purposes, an arbitrage opportunity is when two books are offering such distinct odds that if a bettor makes a particular bet with one book and another particular bet with another book, they can hedge their bets in such a way that they will be guaranteed to make a profit. \n\nThe **Live Sports Odds API** is a free, open source API that tracks the current odds of essentially any given sporting event that is offered by books across the United States. With data from the API, the program is able to find all possible artbitrage opportunities across the eight nearest upcoming sporting events. Once the program finds these opportunities and makes the necessary calculations for the user to understand the output, it writes all findings to an Excel file for the user to access. This file includes the **ID** and **Sport Key** (both of which are specific metrics to the Live Sports Odds API), along with the **Expected Earnings, Bookmaker, Name, Odds**, and **Amount to Buy** with each book for each respective bet. Each row in the file represents one artbitrage opportunity.\n\nAll of the code for this program is included in the **Arbitrage.ipynb** file. Each chunk of code is commented so that the user knows exactly what is happening in each step of the program. Please note that the API does not update instantaneously, and since all books are constantly altering their odds as to eliminate such opportunities for bettors, the program will occasionally output odds that are slightly inaccurate due to the fact that they have already been updated on the book's website. \n\nThe **Books.txt** file contains a list of all of the US bookmakers that are supported by the **Live Sports Odds API** as of 3/17/22 for reference. This information is also on the documentation website for the API listed above.\n\nNOTE: In order to use this project, you will need to acquire an API key from the website linked above. It is entirely free. Once you have done this, add your API key to the **API_KEY.txt** file.\n"

        "readme_contents": "# Sports Tracker Liberator\n\nUnder a catchy name lies an implementation which uses/implements Endomondo Mobile Api.\n\n## Status\n\nCurrently only Endomondo Api is somewhat implemented. Retrieving stuff somewhat works, and submitting new workouts works as in most basic form. All social media crap is ignored.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Authentication\n\nEndomondo implements basic token mechanism, except that earlier versions didn't do that correctly and was only protected by *can't be arsed with it* -securitysystem. Later App versions tried to fix this, while maintaining backward compatibility by implementing a second, `secureToken` param. This is mainly used for social media crap, so we'll conveniently ignore it.\n\nTo authenticate, one needs existing email and password:\n\n\tfrom endomondo import MobileApi\n\tendomondo = MobileApi(email='email@example.com', password='p4ssw0rd')\n\n\tauth_token = endomondo.get_auth_token()\n\nThis will return an `auth_token`, which can be stored on keychain or similar. In future, it should be used to skip whole login juggalloo.\n\n\tendomondo = MobileApi(auth_token=auth_token)\n\n### Retrieving workouts:\nTo retrieve latest workouts:\n\n\tendomondo.get_workouts()\n\nEndomondo Mobile Api provides some oddities, and one of them is that `maxResults` actually work! And as usually in REST APIs, `before` date can be defined:\n\n\tworkouts = endomondo.get_workouts(maxResults=2)\n\tendomondo.get_workouts(before=workouts[-1].start_time)\n\nStructure for `workouts` page is similar to other providers, except paging links are missing.\n\n### Retrieving single workout\n\n`MobileApi.get_workout()` accepts either existing workout, or workout ID.\n\n\tworkout = endomondo.get_workout(workoutId='234246')\n\t[...]\n\treload = endomondo.get_workout(workout)\n\nFor workouts, or workout history, you can pass `fields` param to define, which attributes you are interested at. Again, a bit suprisingly, this works.\n\n\tsocial_workout = endomondo.get_workout(fields=['lcp_count'])\n\nThease attributes aren't documented anywhere, but most of known can be found \u00edn `MobileApi.get_workout()`, and they follow somewhat logical naming conventions.\n\n### Creating a workout and a track.\n\nSome, if not most of program logic lies in mobile app, and server just stores data. This means that one needs to calculate most of their data by themselves.\n\nCurrently only most basic workout creation is supported. Later if/when workout update is added, more features becomes available. This is somewhat related to implementation of Endomondo Mobile Api, as only sport type, calories, hydration, duration and distance in form of track point is created. After initial creation, rest of data is updated to it.\n\nTo create workout:\n\n\tfrom endomondo import MobileApi, Workout, TrackPoint\n\tfrom datetime import datetime\n\n\tendomondo = MobileApi(auth_token='1234')\n\n\tworkout = Workout()\n\n\tworkout.start_time = datetime.utcnow()\n\n\t# See ``workout.sports``\n\tworkout.sport = 0\n\n\t# Units are in user' local units, and only Metric is supported.\n\t# `distance` is in km.\n\t# Note that at creation time, this is not required. It's only used for automatic track point generation.\n\tworkout.distance = 1.5\n\n\t# Duration in seconds\n\tworkout.duration = 600\n\n\tendomondo.post_workout(workout=workout, properties={'audioMessage': 'false'})\n\n\tif workout.id:\n\t\tprint \"Saved!\"\n\nAltought track points aren't technically required by Endomondo backend, which is likely just for a sake of backwards compatibility, and in practice you always want to have at least one `TrackPoint` in your `Workout`. `MobileApi.post_workout()` can automate this, and will create one if none exists.\n\n### Other\n\nFor other, tested, functionality see `main.py`\n\n## Disclaimer, legalese and everything else.\n\nThis is _not_ affiliated or endorset by Endomondo, or any other party. If you are copying this for a commercial project, be aware that it *might* be so that clean room implementation rules aren't fully complied with.\n"

For SportScanner, TV Shows = League Name. For example for 2015/2016 NHL you would do something like the following:\n\n - ~LibraryRoot/NHL/Season 1516/NHL.2015.09.25.New-York-Islanders.vs.Philadelphia-Flyers.720p.HDTV.60fps.x264-Reborn4HD_h.mp4\n\nIn this scenario you still need all the information in the file name, I aim to remove that requirement down the line. The only information that comes only from the folder structure is the season. \n\n## Alternative naming standard\n\nYou can also choose to ignore the season directory and have the scanner work it out with a folder structure like so:\n\n - ~LibraryRoot/Ice Hockey/NHL/NHL.2015.09.25.New-York-Islanders.vs.Philadelphia-Flyers.720p.HDTV.60fps.x264-Reborn4HD_h.mp4\n\n THERE IS A DOWN SIDE TO THIS! For this to work you must include a file in each league directory called \"SportScanner.txt\" that contains information about how the seasons work for this sport. The first line in the file will always be \"XXXX\" or \"XXYY\". \"XXXX\" means that the seasons happens within one calendar year and will therefore be named \"2015\" of \"1999\" for example. \"XXYY\" means that a season occurs across two seasons and will take the format \"1516\" or \"9899\" for example. When you define the season as \"XXYY\" you MUST then on the next line write the integer values of a month and a day in the form \"month,day\". This should be a a month and a day somewhere in the off-season for that sport. This tells the scanner when one season has finished and the next one is beginning to ensure that it puts files in the correct season based off the date the event happened. As an example, if you are trying to add NHL you would create a file at the following path:\n\n  - ~LibraryRoot/Ice Hockey/NHL/SportScanner.txt\n\nIn this instance the contents of this file would be as follows, saying that seasons should be in \"XXYY\" format and a date in the middle of the off-season is 1st July:\n\nXXYY\n7,1\n\n## NOT RECOMMENDED (but works for now)\n\nSportScanner does not actually pay attention to the name of the League directory when it comes to matching events - all info has to be in the filename. This means that you can still group all sports together and as long as they share a season format you can create a SportScanner.txt file as outlined above and everything will work.\n\nThis is rubbish, it kind of accidentally works, I don't recommend it as I will cut it out as part of improvement works in future.\n\n# Known Issues\n - No posters for seasons\n - Can only handle individual files, not multipart or those in folders\n - All information must be in the filename regardless of the directory structure.\n\n# Additional Metadata\n\nThe presence of a .SportScanner metadata file can be used to append additional text to the title of the event as well as override a portion of the episode number.\nNormally the episode number is of the form `YYMMDDHHHH` where YY is the year, MM is the month, DD is the day, and HHHH is based on a hash.  If the first line of the `.SportScanner` file is a number it will be used in place of the hash.\nThe second line of the `.SportScanner` file will be appended to the title of the event.\n\n - ~LibraryRoot/Formula 1/Season 2019/Formula 1 2019-06-30 Austrian Grand Prix - 03 Post-Race Analysis.mp4\n - ~LibraryRoot/Formula 1/Season 2019/Formula 1 2019-06-30 Austrian Grand Prix - 03 Post-Race Analysis.SportScanner\n\nIn the above example, the `Formula 1 2019-06-30 Austrian Grand Prix - 03 Post-Race Analysis.SportScanner` file contains the following text:\n\n```\n3\n(Post-Race Analysis)\n```\n\nThe resulting episode number is `1906300003` and the resulting title is `Austrian Grand Prix (Post-Race Analysis)`\n\n# API Key\n\nif you have your own API key for thesportsdb.com and want to use it, create a file in the SportScanner data directory.  On Linux, this directory is\n```\n/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Data/com.plexapp.agents.sportscanner\n```\nCreate a plain text file named 'SportScanner.ini' in that directory (case sensitive if your OS is) and enter\n```\n[thesportsdb.com]\napikey=<your api key>\n```\n"

This\npackage aims to make this easy regardless of sport needed to be plotted.\n\nThis repository contains code necessary to draw scale versions of\nplaying surfaces to visualize play-by-play data for baseball,\nbasketball, curling, football, hockey, soccer, and tennis in **R**. For\nthe **Python** version of this package, click\n[here](https://github.com/sportsdataverse/sportypy).\n\n## Installation\n\nThe most recent release of `sportyR` is available on\n[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sportyR/index.html), and\nit can be installed directly via:\n\n``` r\n# Install released version from CRAN\ninstall.packages(\"sportyR\")\n```\n\nThe development version of `sportyR` can be installed from\n[GitHub](https://github.com/sportsdataverse/sportyR) with:\n\n``` r\n# Install development version from GitHub\ndevtools::install_github(\"sportsdataverse/sportyR\")\n```\n\nOnce the library is installed, be sure to load it into the working\nenvironment.\n\n``` r\n# Required to use package\nlibrary(sportyR)\n```\n\n## Plotting Functions\n\nAll plotting functions in this library are named as `geom_{sport}()`,\nand take the following arguments:\n\n- `league`: the league code for the sport. In all functions, this will\n  ***NOT*** have a default value. The supplied league is\n  **case-insensitive**. Future iterations of this package may allow the\n  full league name to be supplied if desired (e.g.\n  `league = 'National Basketball Associaton'` instead of\n  `league = 'NBA'`), but this feature is not currently available.\n\n- `display_range`: This automatically \u201czooms\u201d in on the area of the plot\n  you\u2019re interested in. Valid ranges here vary by sport, but can be\n  found by calling `?geom_{sport}` and reading about the display ranges\n\n- `x_trans` and `y_trans`: By default, the origin of the coordinate\n  system *always* lies at the center of the plot. For example, `(0, 0)`\n  on a basketball court lies along the division line and on the line\n  that connects the center of each basket. If you want to shift the\n  origin (and therefore the entire plot), use `x_trans` and `y_trans` to\n  do so\n\n- `{surface_type}_updates`: A list of updates to the parameters that\n  define the surface. I\u2019ll demo how to use this to change a hockey rink\n  in a different vignette, but I\u2019ll call this out here\n\n- `color_updates`: A list that contains updates to the features\u2019 colors\n  on the plot. These are named by what the feature is, using\n  `snake_case` to specify the names. To get the list of color names you\n  can change, try running `cani_color_league_features()` with your\n  desired league\n\n- `rotation`: An angle (in degrees) that you\u2019d like to rotate the plot\n  by, where +is counterclockwise\n\n- `xlims` and `ylims`: Any limits you\u2019d like to put on the plot in the x\n  and y direction. These will overwrite anything set by the\n  `display_range` parameter\n\n- `{surface}_units`: If your data is in units that are different than\n  how the rule book of the league specifies the units (e.g.\u00a0you\u2019ve got\n  NHL data in inches, but the rule book describes the rink in feet),\n  change this parameter to match the units you\u2019ve got your data in.\n  You\u2019re welcome to change the units of the data as well, but this is\n  provided for convenience\n\n## TV View and Display Ranges\n\n### TV View\n\nAll of the `geom_{sport}()` functions, by default, will draw the surface\nin what can be considered \u201cTV view\u201d, or the way that the surface would\ntypically be displayed on a television broadcast. This typically means\nthe action moves from left to right across the screen (a basketball game\nthat has the baskets on the left and right end of the court). As\nmentioned above, it is possible to change this to be in any orientation\nthrough the `rotation` parameter to each `geom_{sport}()` function.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to this:\n\n- `geom_baseball()` is displayed from the high-home view by default, as\n  baseball coordinates typically have the `+y` axis extending from the\n  back tip of home plate towards center field\n\n- `geom_tennis()` is displayed with the court diagrammed from the\n  perspective of the chair umpire\n\n### Display Ranges\n\nRelated to the idea of custom displays of the plot is the concept of the\n`display_range` parameter in the `geom_{sport}()` function. This is\nunique to each sport, but globally supported across the package. This\nparameter allows the specification of a designated region of the surface\nto display. As an example, if you\u2019re trying to limit the analysis of NFL\ndata to being inside of the red zone, you may want to do something\nsimilar to the following:\n\n``` r\n# Display only the red zone of the football field\ngeom_football(\"nfl\", display_range = \"red zone\")\n```\n\n<img src=\"man/figures/README-readme-display-range-demo-1.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nAnother use case would be to make the data you\u2019re viewing easier to see.\nSay you wanted to look at curling data, but only cared about stone\npositions in the house (and not the path as to how the stones got\nthere). You might do this:\n\n``` r\n# Display only the house on a curling sheet\ngeom_curling(\"wcf\", display_range = \"house\")\n```\n\n<img src=\"man/figures/README-readme-display-range-curling-demo-1.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## Plot Units\n\nEach plot function has a standardized unit of measure in which the plot\nis created, and is standardized by the primary units specified in their\nrespective rule books. They are as follows (and any explanation is in\nparentheses):\n\n|   Sport    |              League              | Primary Plotting Unit |\n|:----------:|:--------------------------------:|:---------------------:|\n|  Baseball  |          Little League           |         `ft`          |\n|  Baseball  |               MiLB               |         `ft`          |\n|  Baseball  |               MLB                |         `ft`          |\n|  Baseball  |               NCAA               |         `ft`          |\n|  Baseball  |        NFHS (High School)        |         `ft`          |\n|  Baseball  |               Pony               |         `ft`          |\n| Basketball |               FIBA               |          `m`          |\n| Basketball |               NBA                |         `ft`          |\n| Basketball |           NBA G League           |         `ft`          |\n| Basketball |               NCAA               |         `ft`          |\n| Basketball |               NFHS               |         `ft`          |\n| Basketball |               WNBA               |         `ft`          |\n|  Curling   |  WCF (World Curling Federation)  |         `ft`          |\n|  Football  |               CFL                |         `yd`          |\n|  Football  |               NCAA               |         `yd`          |\n|  Football  | NFHS11 (High School, 11 players) |         `yd`          |\n|  Football  |  NFHS6 (High School, 6 players)  |         `yd`          |\n|  Football  |  NFHS8 (High School, 8 players)  |         `yd`          |\n|  Football  |  NFHS9 (High School, 9 players)  |         `yd`          |\n|  Football  |               NFL                |         `yd`          |\n|   Hockey   |               AHL                |         `ft`          |\n|   Hockey   |               ECHL               |         `ft`          |\n|   Hockey   |               IIHF               |          `m`          |\n|   Hockey   |               NCAA               |         `ft`          |\n|   Hockey   |               NHL                |         `ft`          |\n|   Hockey   |               NWHL               |         `ft`          |\n|   Hockey   |               OHL                |         `ft`          |\n|   Hockey   |               PHF                |         `ft`          |\n|   Hockey   |              QMJHL               |         `ft`          |\n|   Hockey   |               USHL               |         `ft`          |\n|  Lacrosse  |              NCAAM               |         `yd`          |\n|  Lacrosse  |              NCAAW               |          `m`          |\n|  Lacrosse  |               NLL                |         `ft`          |\n|  Lacrosse  |               PLL                |         `yd`          |\n|  Lacrosse  |            USA Men\u2019s             |         `yd`          |\n|  Lacrosse  |           USA Women\u2019s            |          `m`          |\n|  Lacrosse  |          World Lacrosse          |         `ft`          |\n|   Soccer   |               EPL                |          `m`          |\n|   Soccer   |               FIFA               |          `m`          |\n|   Soccer   |               MLS                |         `yd`          |\n|   Soccer   |               NCAA               |         `yd`          |\n|   Soccer   |               NWSL               |         `yd`          |\n|   Tennis   |               ATP                |         `ft`          |\n|   Tennis   |               ITA                |         `ft`          |\n|   Tennis   |               ITF                |         `ft`          |\n|   Tennis   |               NCAA               |         `ft`          |\n|   Tennis   |               USTA               |         `ft`          |\n|   Tennis   |               WTA                |         `ft`          |\n| Volleyball |               FIVB               |          `m`          |\n| Volleyball |               NCAA               |          `m`          |\n| Volleyball |          USA Volleyball          |          `m`          |\n\nHowever, since the data that is supplied may come in various units of\nmeasure, the plots are able to be generated in the data\u2019s units. This is\ndone via the `unit` argument in `geom_{sport}()`. The features\nthemselves will look visually identical, but the underlying coordinate\ngrid will change.\n\nAdditionally, the `convert_units()` function can be called on a data\nframe to convert from the data\u2019s arguments to the plot\u2019s. For example,\nif soccer data is given in yards, but is desirable to be plotted in\nmeters, calling\n`convert_units(tracking_data, 'yd', 'm', conversion_columns = c('x', 'y'))`\nwill convert the x and y coordinates from yards to meters.\n\nAs mentioned [above](#plotting-functions), the `geom_{sport}()` family\nof functions allow for rotations of surfaces via the `rotation`\nargument. To make this easy, `sportyR` also allows for the rotation of\ndata frames\u2019 coordinates ***so long as they contain an*** `x` ***and***\n`y` ***column*** via the `rotate_coords()` function. Reflection is also\npossible through `reflect()`.\n\n## Surface Examples\n\nMost playing surfaces are standard in size, so they can be rendered via\na call to the proper `geom_{sport}()` function like so:\n\n``` r\n# Draw a basic MLB infield plot\ngeom_baseball(\"mlb\", display_range = \"infield\")\n```\n\n<img src=\"man/figures/README-readme-mlb-example-1.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n``` r\n# Create a 100m by 75m FIFA pitch\ngeom_soccer(\n  \"fifa\",\n  pitch_updates = list(\n    pitch_length = 100,\n    pitch_width = 75\n  )\n)\n```\n\n<img src=\"man/figures/README-readme-fifa-example-1.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to plot partial surfaces and rotated surfaces:\n\n``` r\n# Draw half of a rotated NBA court\ngeom_basketball(\"nba\", display_range = \"offense\", rotation = 270)\n```\n\n<img src=\"man/figures/README-readme-nhl-example-1.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## License\n\nThis package is released under the [GPL 3.0\nLicense](https://github.com/sportsdataverse/sportyR/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n\n## Contributions\n\n### League Office\n\nThe package maintainers and functional engineers\n\n- [Ross Drucker](https://github.com/rossdrucker) - `sportyR`\n  Commissioner\n\n### General Managers\n\nContribute by adding a new sport and become its general manager.

Students will gain foundational knowledge of deep learning algorithms and get practical experience in building neural networks in TensorFlow. \n\n\nPrerequisites \nWe expect basic knowledge of calculus (e.g., taking derivatives), linear algebra (e.g., matrix multiplication), and probability (e.g., Bayes theorem) -- we'll try to explain everything else along the way! Experience in Python is helpful but not necessary. This class is taught during MIT's IAP term by current MIT PhD researchers. Listeners are welcome!\n\n\nThis repository contains all of the code and software labs for MIT 6.S191: Introduction to Deep Learning! All lecture slides and videos are available on the course website. http://introtodeeplearning.com/\n\nOpening the labs in Google Colaboratory:\nThe 2021 6.S191 labs will be run in Google's Colaboratory, a Jupyter notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud, you don't need to download anything. To run these labs, you must have a Google account.\n\nOn this Github repo, navigate to the lab folder you want to run (lab1, lab2, lab3) and open the appropriate python notebook (*.ipynb). Click the \"Run in Colab\" link on the top of the lab. That's it!\n\nRunning the labs\nNow, to run the labs, open the Jupyter notebook on Colab. Navigate to the \"Runtime\" tab --> \"Change runtime type\". In the pop-up window, under \"Runtime type\" select \"Python 3\", and under \"Hardware accelerator\" select \"GPU\". Go through the notebooks and fill in the #TODO cells to get the code to compile for yourself!\n\nMIT Deep Learning package\nYou might notice that inside the labs we install the mitdeeplearning python package from the Python Package repository:\n\npip install mitdeeplearning\n\nThis package contains convienence functions that we use throughout the course and can be imported like any other Python package.\n\n>>> import mitdeeplearning as mdl\n\nWe do this for you in each of the labs, but the package is also open source under the same license so you can also use it outside the class.\n"

Only the search results with **720P** resolution, **25 FPS**, and official recording are downloaded.

Furthermore, the views of the playing courts do vary, which include common side view of crowded audience like in NBA, views from the serve zone in volleyball games, and aerial view in football games. Diverse scenes in our dataset will encourage the algorithms to generalize to different sports tracking settings\n### Basic Statstics\n\n| Category(avg.) | #frames | #tracks | track gap len | track length | #bboxes per frame (density) |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| Basketball     | 845.4   | 10      | 68.7          | 767.9        | 9.1                         |\n| Volleyball     | 360.4   | 12      | 38.2          | 335.9        | 11.2                        |\n| Football       | 673.9   | 20.5    | 116.1         | 422.1        | 12.8                        |\n\n<p style = \"text-align:center;color:gray;font-size:0.7em;text-indent:0\">basic statistics of videos of 3 categories.</p>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Explanation for the statistics above :mag:</summary>\n\n- track: number of tracks per video.\n- tracklen: average length/number of frames per video\n- fragmentation: average number of track fragmentation per video.\n- speed: average speed of the players in videos.\n- density: average number of players per frame per video.\n- bboxsize: average size of bounding boxes(pixels).\n- defrate: average `deformationRate`\n\nWe use **deformation rate** to measure the degree of deformation.

We expect SportsMOT to encourage the community to concentrate more on the complicated sports scenes.\n\n## Data Format\n\nData in SportsMOT is organized in the form of [MOT Challenge 17](https://motchallenge.net/).\n\nUnzip the provided .zip file, you will get\n\n- `splits_txt`(video-split mapping)\n  - `basketball.txt`\n  - `volleyball.txt`\n  - `football.txt`\n  - `train.txt`\n    <details><summary>details</summary>\n\n    ```text\n    v_-6Os86HzwCs_c001\n    v_-6Os86HzwCs_c003\n    v_-6Os86HzwCs_c007\n    v_-6Os86HzwCs_c009\n    v_2j7kLB-vEEk_c001\n    v_2j7kLB-vEEk_c002 \n    ``` \n    \n    </details>\n  - `val.txt`\n  - `test.txt`\n- `scripts`\n  - `mot_to_coco.py`\n  - `sportsmot_to_trackeval.py`\n- `dataset`(in MOT challenge format)\n  - `train`\n    - `VIDEO_NAME1`\n      - `gt`\n        <details><summary>details</summary>\n\n        ```text\n        1, 7, 749, 217, 34, 125, 1, 1, 1\n        1, 8, 721, 344, 71, 120, 1, 1, 1\n        1, 9, 847, 352, 50, 151, 1, 1, 1\n        2, 0, 85, 421, 88, 131, 1, 1, 1 \n        ``` \n        \n        </details>\n      - `img1`\n        - `000001.jpg`\n        - `000002.jpg`\n      - `seqinfo.ini`\n        <details><summary>details</summary>\n\n        ```text\n        [Sequence]\n        name=v_-6Os86HzwCs_c001\n        imDir=img1\n        frameRate=25\n        seqLength=825\n        imWidth=1280\n        imHeight=720\n        imExt=.jpg\n        ``` \n        \n        </details>\n  - `val`\n    - the same hierarchy as train\n  - `test`\n    - `VIDEO_NAME1`\n      - `img1`\n        - `000001.jpg`\n        - `000002.jpg`\n      - `seqinfo.ini`\n\nYou can download the example for SportsMOT.\n\n- [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtjeLq7YnYGRgQRrmqGr4B-k-xsC?e=7PndU8)\n- [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gytkTngxoGFlmP9_DBd1xw), password: 4dnw\n\n## Usage\n\n### Download\n\nPlease Sign up in codalab, and participate in our [competition](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/12424#participate).

The employing of two separate graph neural networks allows to consider \nand share both past and future information while generating agents' future movements.\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* Python >= 3.8\n* PyTorch >= 1.5\n* CUDA 10.0\n\n### Installation\n\n* Clone this repo:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/alexmonti19/dagnet.git\ncd dagnet\n```\n\n* Create a new virtual environment using Conda or virtualenv. \n```\nconda create --name <envname>\n```\n* Activate the environment and install the requirements:\n```\nconda activate <envname>\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n\n## Datasets\nOur proposal is general enough to be applied in different scenarios: the model achieves state-of-the-art results in both\nurban environments (*Stanford Drone Dataset*) and sports applications (*STATS SportVU NBA Dataset*).   \n\nFor complete information on where to download and how to preprocess the datasets see the relative \n[datasets/README.md](./datasets/README.md).\n\n## Architectures\nThe repo contains both the final model and the two ablation architectures cited in the paper.\n- *VRNN*: the baseline generative architecture\n- *A-VRNN*: enhanced version of the baseline with a single graph (on agents' hidden states)\n- *DAG-Net*: the complete architecture with two graphs\n\nFor more information on how to train the models see the relative [models/README.md](./models/README.md).\n\n## Pre-trained models\nWe also ship the checkpoints to reproduce the results presented in the paper. \n\n<table>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <th>\n            <th align=\"center\" colspan=2 style=\"text-align:center\">Offense BSK</th>\n            <th align=\"center\" colspan=2 style=\"text-align:center\">Defense BSK</th>\n            <th align=\"center\" colspan=2 style=\"text-align:center\">Stanford Drone</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\"></td>\n            <td align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:bold\">ADE</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:bold\">FDE</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:bold\">ADE</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:bold\">FDE</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:bold\">ADE</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:bold\">FDE</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>VRNN</td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\">9,41</td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\">15,56</td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\">7,16</td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\">10,50</td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\">0,58</td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\">1,17</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>A-VRNN</td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\">9,48</td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\">15,52</td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\">7,05</td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\">10,34</td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\">0,56</td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\">1,14</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>DAG-Net</td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>8,98</em></td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>14,08</em></td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>6,87</em></td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>9,76</em></td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>0,53</em></td>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>1,04</em></td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\nFor more information on how to test the models and produce the above results, see the relative \n[models/README.md](./models/README.md).\n\n## Cite\nIf you have any questions, please contact [alessio.monti@unimore.it](mailto:alessio.monti@unimore.it) or \n[alessia.bertugli@unimore.it](mailto:alessia.bertugli@unimore.it), or open an issue on this repo. \n\nIf you find this repository useful for your research, please cite the following paper:\n```bibtex\n@proceedings{monti2020dagnet,\n    title={DAG-Net: Double Attentive Graph Neural Network for Trajectory Forecasting},\n    author={Alessio Monti and Alessia Bertugli and Simone Calderara and Rita Cucchiara},\n    booktitle = {25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)},\n    year={2020}\n}\n```\n"

In general I would recommend using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) \nLatest 64 bit for your operating system.\n\n### Install Steps\nWindows:  \n1. Download [Minconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) -- Select Latest Windows 64 bit\n1. Install and select the option to add Minconda to your system path (it isn't default)\n1. Install [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)\n1. [Optional but recommended] Install [git-bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n1. Open windows terminal and select a shell of your choice, on Windows I use Command Prompt or Git Bash\n1. Test that conda was installed```  conda info  ```\n  should give something like \n  ```\n  active environment : None\n         user config file : C:\\Users\\minim\\.condarc\n   populated config files :\n            conda version : 4.10.1\n      conda-build version : not installed\n           python version : 3.9.1.final.0\n         virtual packages : __cuda=11.3=0\n                            __win=0=0\n                            __archspec=1=x86_64\n         base environment : C:\\Users\\minim\\miniconda3  (writable)\n        conda av data dir : C:\\Users\\minim\\miniconda3\\etc\\conda\n    conda av metadata url : https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main\n             channel URLs : https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/win-64\n                            https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/noarch\n                            https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/win-64\n                            https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/noarch\n                            https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/msys2/win-64\n                            https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/msys2/noarch\n            package cache : C:\\Users\\minim\\miniconda3\\pkgs\n                            C:\\Users\\minim\\.conda\\pkgs\n                            C:\\Users\\minim\\AppData\\Local\\conda\\conda\\pkgs\n         envs directories : C:\\Users\\minim\\miniconda3\\envs\n                            C:\\Users\\minim\\.conda\\envs\n                            C:\\Users\\minim\\AppData\\Local\\conda\\conda\\envs\n                 platform : win-64\n               user-agent : conda/4.10.1 requests/2.25.0 CPython/3.9.1 Windows/10 Windows/10.0.19041\n            administrator : False\n               netrc file : None\n             offline mode : False\n  ```\n7.

The idea is that you place the camera in front of a target, then monitor it from the firing point. The camera on its own would be very useful for this, but with a bit of image processing it can be even more so. Accordingly, in this mode, each time you press a key a new image is taken and compared to the last. The difference should be the most recent shot, which will be highlighted. You can also review previous shots at any time, which will highlight each shot in situ on the current target image.\n\n![BlamCam](/images/blamcam.jpg)\n\n# known issues / further development\n\nSince there is no published API for this type of camera, it was reverse engineered by sniffing packets from the Android app. Not all settings visible on the camera can be changed from the app, so some things are still unknown or may be incorrect.\n\nThere are several tools out there for doing this, and I used one that allows sniffing of only the local network traffic without rooting the phone:\n\n  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.greyshirts.sslcapture&hl=en_GB\n\nIt's a bit clunky and doesn't have any kind of filtering support, so you have to wade through a lot of irrelevant data to find the packet you're looking for, but it was easy to install and run and got the ball rolling, so I stuck with it.\n\nI only have access to the SJ4000 camera, so it's possible other cameras behave completely differently - please let me know your experiences!\n\nCommands can be tested by sending them directly to the camera using a browser. For example, to change the WiFi name:\n\n  http://192.168.1.254/?custom=1&cmd=3003&str=%22MyShinySJ4000%22\n\nIf you find any new or useful commands, please email me details, or send me a pull request. I have commented some as yet unexplored options in sj4000.py\n\nAt some point, it would be nice to have a GUI.\n\nNeed to add GET option to video start/stop...\n\nNeed to fix camera directory to show file sizes, dates etc. (strange problem with BS4)\n\nFind better lens options for BlamCam (in progress)\n\nReally really need a better GUI for BlamCam!\n"

But please note that it may take a few moments before we receive the email and accept your request.\n\nMultiSports Dataset License: [CC BY_NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)\n\n## Download Person Boxes\n\nWe provide the **person boxes** generated by the person detector of Faster R-CNN with a ResNeXt-101-FPN backbone in the links below. We finetune the person detector only with the train set data.\n\nOnedrive: https://1drv.ms/f/s!AtjeLq7YnYGRe3eQMuQk5GYYu40\n\nBaidu Wangpan: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zOylA-idz2foeEaU1gx6sw (password: 5ccx)\n\nThe pkl file has the below data structure:\n```\n{\"video_name, frame_number\":boxes}\n\nvideo_name: str\n\nframe_number: int (starts from 1)\n```\nboxes: a numpy array with n rows and 5 columns, \\<x1\\> \\<y1\\> \\<x2\\> \\<y2\\> \\<score\\>. x1, x2, y1, y2 are normalized with respect to frame size, which are between 0.0-1.0. We only save the box with score higher than 0.05.\n\n## SlowFast Det.\n\nWe run the SlowFast Det. from [mmaction2](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/tree/main) and change the [mmaction/datasets/ava_dataset.py](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/blob/main/mmaction/datasets/ava_dataset.py) into [multisports_dataset.py](https://github.com/MCG-NJU/MultiSports/blob/main/multisports_dataset.py) for our MultiSports Dataset. \n\n## Evaluation Tools\n\n**evaluate_multisports.py** is our evaluation code, which is modified from ACT(https://github.com/vkalogeiton/caffe/blob/act-detector/act-detector-scripts/ACT.py). We change the calculation of PR (Precision-Recall) area same with PASCAL VOC.\n```\nUsage:\npython3 evaluate_multisports.py task gt_file detection_file -t thr\n\nevaluate frameAP:\npython3 evaluate_multisports.py frameAP multisports_GT.pkl frame_detections.pkl\nevaluate videoAP:\npython3 evaluate_multisports.py videoAP multisports_GT.pkl video_detections.pkl -t 0.2\nevaluate videoAP with different thresholds:\npython3 evaluate_multisports.py videoAP_all multisports_GT.pkl video_detections.pkl\nanalyze videoAP error:\npython3 evaluate_multisports.py videoAP_error multisports_GT.pkl video_detections.pkl -t 0.2\n```\n**frame_detections.pkl** is a list. Every item is a numpy array with shape (8,) , numpy.array([video_index, frame_number, label_index, score, x1, y1, x2, y2]). video_index is the index of the video in the multisports_GT['test_videos'][0], which starts from 0. For example, 0 is the index of 'aerobic_gymnastics/v_crsi07chcV8_c004' in multisports_GT['test_videos'][0]. frame_number starts from 1. label_index starts from 0. score is the score of this box, which affects the frame mAP result.\n\n**video_detections.pkl** is a dictionary that associates from each index of label (start from 0), a list of tubes. A tube is a tuple (tube_v, tube_score, tube_boxes). tube_v is the video name, such as 'aerobic_gymnastics/v_crsi07chcV8_c004'. tube_score is the score of this tube, which affects the video mAP result. tube_boxes is a numpy array with tube-length rows and 6 columns, every row is [frame number, x1, y1, x2, y2, box_score]. frame number starts from 1. box_score is the single frame's confidence and does not affect the video mAP result. \n\nWe provide examples of frame_detections.pkl and video_detections.pkl of slowonly in [examples](https://github.com/MCG-NJU/MultiSports/tree/main/examples), whose evaluation results with different PR area calculation are shown below.\n\n|  | frameAP@0.5 | videoAP@0.2 | videoAP@0.5 |\n|---|---|---|:--|\n| PR_ACT | 16.84 | 15.75 | 5.84 |\n| PR_PASCAL_VOC | 17.03 | 15.86 | 5.88 |\n\n\n\n<!-- ## Prediction Example\n\n**submissions.zip** is our example submission file on 50% test set.\n -->\n\nIf you find our code or paper useful, please cite as\n```\n@InProceedings{Li_2021_ICCV,\n    author    = {Li, Yixuan and Chen, Lei and He, Runyu and Wang, Zhenzhi and Wu, Gangshan and Wang, Limin},\n    title     = {MultiSports: A Multi-Person Video Dataset of Spatio-Temporally Localized Sports Actions},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)},\n    month     = {October},\n    year      = {2021},\n    pages     = {13536-13545}\n}\n```\n"

        "readme_contents": "# TableChamp\n\n**Tablesports leaderboard app**\nTrack each ping pong, pool, foosball, air hockey, or shuffleboard game that's played. Find out who really is number one (in your office, or out of your group of friends).\n\n## What is it?\n\nWith TableChamp, you can add players, track every game that is played, and always know who's #1.\n\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5634774/209989745-877b4a3b-50f1-47d4-a507-b1f7fa300660.gif)\n\nYou can view stats on each player, including their 20 most recent games:\n\n![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5634774/209989780-52acd163-eaa8-407f-a559-b7e3310961ca.gif)\n\nYou can manage all of the settings of the app in one convenient sidebar:\n\n![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5634774/209989811-8932abbd-2a15-44aa-90fb-1d6f2f05d78e.gif)\n\nYou can even select from one of 14 languages:\n\n![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5634774/209989854-4d68f5c2-617f-41cf-8af7-d1f8c9c971f0.gif)\n\n## How does it work?\n\nTableChamp is written entirely in JS/HTML/CSS. There is no back-end code (like python, or PHP). It uses [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/) as a back-end real-time DB to store all of the data, and manage the user authentication.\n\n## Installation\n\n### 1) You'll need a hosting account for the JS/HTML/CSS files\n\n*NOTE: you can run a FireBase app locally, but you'll need to follow [these instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/) to get set up with FireBase CLI.*\n\nJust clone this entire project to your server. Once you've done that, move on to step 2.\n\n### 2) You'll need to sign up for a free FireBase account\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5634774/209989202-dd871ea4-9d37-4cec-acfc-04a234b3a054.png)\n\nEven if you have a large team, the [free FireBase account](https://firebase.google.com/pricing/) should offer plenty of resources. \n\nOnce you've signed up for a free FireBase account, move on to the next step.\n\n### 3) Create a new FireBase app\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5634774/209989227-9b39abc3-0982-4644-8dad-229444578de3.png)\n\nGo through the process of creating a new FireBase Project. You can name it \"Table Champ\", or anything you'd like.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5634774/209989248-cde54bd5-1ae6-4167-9cef-4afe74b772f2.png)\n\nFind the \"Add to your web app\" option, and click it:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5634774/209989282-0bddb656-3d8a-4f8b-80f2-023c27b47a92.png)\n\nYou now have all of the information you need to connect to connect the app to FireBase:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5634774/209989305-61353e80-c2ac-4a84-a498-e7045ad52497.png)\n\nOnce you have your FireBase API info, move on to the next step\n\n### 4) Copy your FireBase info to the /js/firebase-key.js file\n\nOpen up /js/firebase-key.js:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5634774/209989350-46f75d12-1c10-4876-ac20-a952187c4776.png)\n\nPaste in the FireBase apiKey, authDomain, and databaseURL from step 3 above:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5634774/209989379-697262d7-b840-4cd8-b43b-2b6c7ada3de7.png)\n\nOnce you've done this, save your changes, and move on to the next step.\n\n### 5) Add your first FireBase user\n\nFireBase handles storing all of your data, as well as authentication. We'll need to set up a user in the FireBase admin, so that you can log into your app. I'll walk you through how to add a single user, but you can add as many login users as you'd like.\n\n*NOTE: Users are separate from players.

It upgrades a rowing machine into a smart trainer that can be used with training applications and games.\n\nOpen Rowing Monitor is a Node.js application that runs on a Raspberry Pi and measures the rotation of the rower's flywheel (or similar) to calculate rowing specific metrics, such as power, split time, speed, stroke rate, distance and calories.\n\nIt is currently developed and tested with a Sportstech WRX700 water-rower. But it should run fine with any rowing machine that uses some kind of damping mechanism, as long as you can add something to measure the speed of the flywheel.\nIt should also work well with DIY rowing machines like the [Openergo](https://openergo.webs.com).\n\n## Features\n\nThe following items describe most of the current features, more functionality will be added in the future, check the [Development Roadmap](backlog.md) if you are curious.\n\n### Rowing Metrics\n\nOpen Rowing Monitor implements a physics model to simulate the typical metrics of a rowing boat based on the pull on the handle. The physics model can be tuned to the specifics of a rower by changing some model parameters.\n\n* Stroke detection\n* Power (watts)\n* Split time (/500m)\n* Strokes per Minute\n* Calories used (kcal)\n* Training Duration\n* Heart Rate (supports BLE and ANT+ heart rate monitors, ANT+ requires an ANT+ USB stick)\n\n### Web Interface\n\nThe web interface visualizes the rowing metrics on any device that can run a web browser (i.e. a smartphone that you attach to your rowing machine while training). It uses web sockets to show the rowing status in realtime. It can also be used to reset the training metrics and to select the BLE Rower.\n\nIf you connect a screen to the Raspberry Pi, then this interface can also be directly shown on the device. The installation script can set up a web browser in kiosk mode that runs on the Raspberry Pi.\n\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-inline-html -->\n<img src=\"img/openrowingmonitor_frontend.png\" width=\"700\"><br clear=\"left\">\n\n### Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)\n\nOpen Rowing Monitor also implements different Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocols so you can use your rowing machine with different fitness applications.\n\nFitness Machine Service (FTMS) is a standardized GATT protocol for different types of fitness machines. Open Rowing Monitor currently supports the type **FTMS Rower** and simulates the type **FTMS Indoor Bike**.\n\n**FTMS Rower:** This is the FTMS profile for rowing machines and supports all rowing specific metrics (such as stroke rate). So far not many training applications for this profile exist, but the market is evolving. I've successfully tested it with [EXR](https://www.exrgame.com), [MyHomeFit](https://myhomefit.de) and [Kinomap](https://www.kinomap.com).\n\n**FTMS Indoor Bike:** This FTMS profile is used by Smart Bike Trainers and widely adopted by training applications for bike training. It does not support rowing specific metrics. But it can present metrics such as power and distance to the biking application and use cadence for stroke rate. So why not use your virtual rowing bike to row up a mountain in [Zwift](https://www.zwift.com), [Bkool](https://www.bkool.com), [The Sufferfest](https://thesufferfest.com) or similar :-)\n\n**Concept2 PM:** Open Rowing Monitor also implements part of the Concept2 PM Bluetooth Smart Communication Interface Definition. This is still work in progress and only implements the most common parts of the spec, so it will not work with all applications that support C2 rowing machines. It currently works with all the samples from [The Erg Arcade](https://ergarcade.com), i.e. you can [row in the clouds](https://ergarcade.github.io/mrdoob-clouds/). This also works very well with [EXR](https://www.exrgame.com).\n\n### Export of Training Sessions\n\nOpen Rowing Monitor can create Training Center XML files (TCX). You can upload these files to training platforms like [Strava](https://www.strava.com), [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com) or [Trainingpeaks](https://trainingpeaks.com) to track your training sessions.\n\nUploading your sessions to Strava is an integrated feature, for all other platforms this is currently a manual step. The installer can set up a network share that contains all training data so it is easy to grab the files from there and upload them to the training platform of your choice.\n\nOpen Rowing Monitor can also store the raw measurements of the flywheel into CSV files. These files are great to start your own exploration of your rowing style and also to learn about the specifics of your rowing machine (some Excel files that can help with this are included in the `docs` folder).\n\n## Installation\n\nYou will need a Raspberry Pi Zero W, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, Raspberry Pi 3 or a Raspberry Pi 4 with a fresh installation of Raspberry Pi OS Lite for this. Connect to the device with SSH and initiate the following command to install Open Rowing Monitor as an automatically starting system service:\n\n```zsh\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laberning/openrowingmonitor/HEAD/install/install.sh)\"\n```\n\nAlso have a look at the [Detailed Installation Instructions](installation.md) for more information on the software installation and for instructions on how to connect the rowing machine.\n\n## How it all started\n\nI originally started this project, because my rowing machine (Sportstech WRX700) has a very simple computer and I wanted to build something with a clean interface that calculates more realistic metrics. Also, this was a good reason to learn a bit more about Bluetooth and all its specifics.\n\nThe original proof of concept version started as a sketch on an Arduino, but when I started adding things like a web frontend and BLE I moved it to the much more powerful Raspberry Pi. Maybe using a Raspberry Pi for this small IoT-project is a bit of an overkill, but it has the capacity for further features such as syncing training data or rowing games. And it has USB-Ports that I can use to charge my phone while rowing :-)\n\n## Further information\n\nThis project is already in a very usable stage, but some things are still a bit rough on the edges.\n\nFeel free to leave a message in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/laberning/openrowingmonitor/discussions) if you have any questions or ideas related to this project.\n\nCheck the advanced information on the [Physics behind Open Rowing Monitor](physics_openrowingmonitor.md).\n\nI plan to add more features, here is the [Development Roadmap](backlog.md). Contributions are welcome, please read the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.\n\nThis project uses some great work by others, see the [Attribution here](attribution.md).\n"

Each league has its own unique algorithm to predict winners, with NBA having the most accurate algorithm. The system was originally intended to be used for sports betting. The algorithms are pretty good at predicting winners. With sports betting, it also has to be better at predicting winners than other betters, and the oddsmakers. \n\n\n\n\n[The NHL algorithm predicted the 2016 Stanley Cup Champion team, and its NHL playoff bracket was in the 99th percentile](http://smartsoftware.technology/sports.php?view=nhl&season=2016)\n\n[Backtest results of betting strategies utilizing the algorithms' predictions](http://smartsoftware.technology/sports.php)\n\n\n-----\n\nAlgorithms to predict NBA, NHL, and MLB games are included. To utilize, run sports_bettor.py\n\n*sports_bettor.py*  \n\n```\nLeague\n1) NBA\n2) NHL\n3) NFL\n4) MLB\nChoice:\n```\n\nIf you want to find the winner for an NBA game, pick 1. \n\n```\nLeague: nba\nMenu:\n1) Single team analysis\n2) Calculate game odds (Single Game)\n3) Calculate game odds (ALL Games Today)\n4) Backtest algorithm\n5) Test schedule scraper\nChoice: \n```\n\nIf you want to find the winner for a single game, choose 2. \n\n```\nBacktest menu: Algorithm version:\n1) Algo_V1 - Uses a point system\n2) Algo_V2 - Uses a probability system\nChoice:\n```\n\nAlgo_V2 tends to be more accurate. It gives a percentage of a team to win a game, while Algo_V1 gives an absolute number of points where the higher number of points for a team, the higher chance of them winning. \n\n```\nnba teams:\n0: atlanta-hawks\n1: boston-celtics\n2: brooklyn-nets\n3: charlotte-hornets\n4: chicago-bulls\n5: cleveland-cavaliers\n6: dallas-mavericks\n7: denver-nuggets\n8: detroit-pistons\n9: golden-state-warriors\n10: houston-rockets\n11: indiana-pacers\n12: los-angeles-clippers\n13: los-angeles-lakers\n14: memphis-grizzlies\n15: miami-heat\n16: milwaukee-bucks\n17: minnesota-timberwolves\n18: new-orleans-pelicans\n19: new-york-knicks\n20: oklahoma-city-thunder\n21: orlando-magic\n22: philadelphia-76ers\n23: phoenix-suns\n24: portland-trail-blazers\n25: sacramento-kings\n26: san-antonio-spurs\n27: toronto-raptors\n28: utah-jazz\n29: washington-wizards\nAway Team #:\nHome Team #: \n```\n\nChoose the number corresponding to the away team and home team for the NBA game. The system was scrape the latest game data for the 2 teams, run the algorithm, and then output the data (and save to a file in nba\\analyze\\team_comparison). \n\n\n```\nDate to test (M-D-YYY): 4-16-2017\nCurrent season year: 2017\n```\n\n\"Date to test\" means that all games played before that date will be included in the calculation. Typically, this would just be the current date if you want to include all games. \nThe current season year will need to be provided. \n\n\nUsing an example game Portland Trail Blazers @ Golden State Warriors in the 2017 NBA playoffs, the output is \n\n```\nAway: portland-trail-blazers | Home: golden-state-warriors\nSeasonal Record:      -81.53%\nHome Away:            -91.33%\nHome away 10:         -59.94%\nLast 10 games:        -56.04%\nAvg points:           -78.74%\nAvg points 10:        -60.38%\n--------\nTotal: -71.32%\n--------\nPerc chance to win: 71.32%\nFavorable team odds: -248.6750348675034\nUnderdog team odds: +248.6750348675034\n```\n\nA positive total gives favorability to the away team, and a negative Total gives favorability to the home team. The total in this example is -71.32%, so the Golden State Warriors have a supposed 71.32% chance of winning the game. \n\nFavorable odds are given that are based off the percentage chance to win. In order for a bet to be +Expected Value, whether on the favorite orunderdog team, the odds would have to be higher than the given odds in the output. The favorite team is expected to win 71.23% of the time, so a bet on them should be no less than -248.67. Good bets include -240, -150, +150, etc. Bad bets include -250, -500, etc. Same for the underdog team where good bets would be higher than +248.67, like +250 and +550, while bad bets would be lower, like +200, +150, etc. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n### Bare-bones algorithm information:\n\n**Variables:** \n1) Record_points = ( wins - losses ) - ( other_wins - other_losses)\n2) Home_away = (away_record - home_record) - (other tema's away record - other team's home record)\n3) Home_away_10_games = Home_away for last 10 games\n4) Last_10_games_points = Record_points for last 10 games\n5) Avg_points = (total_points/num_games) - (other_total_points/num_games)\n6) Avg_points_10_games = Avg_points for last 10 games\n7) Win_streak = num consecutive wins\n8) Win_streak_home_away = num consecutive wins home or away\n\n*Example:* \nNBA's algo_V2 includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\nNHL's algo_V2 includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8\nMLB's algo_V2 includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\n**Backtests:** \n\n*CSV_output* = Backtest all games for 2nd half of seasons in specified timespan.

Navigate to the directory using command prompt and type the following command\n  ```\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  ```\nOr for MacOS\n```\n  pip install -r requirements_macos.txt\n  ```\n## Jupyter Notebook\n  * Navigate to the location where you have cloned the GitHub repository and open the interactive notebook.\n  * Open the .ipynb file.\n  * Run the first cell by clicking the play button or using the shortcut ```Shift + Enter``` through your keyboard. If all the libraries are installed succesffuly this code block should execute without throwing any errors.\n  * Run the subsequent cell blocks to load the data.\n  * Choose a file between men's data, women's data and combined dataset using the dropdown list.\n    * Men's dataset - MLS 2022 season\n    * Women's dataset - NWSL 2022 season + International Women's soccer\n    * Combined dataset - Combination of both men and women's data\n  * Choose the adjacency matrix from the dropdown list.\n    * normal - connects attacking players amongst themselves, defensive players amongst themselves and the attacking and defending players are conencted through the ball.\n    * delaunay - connects a few attacking players and defending players in a delaunay matrix fashion\n    * dense - connects all the players and the ball to each other\n    * dense_ap - connects all the attacking players to each other and defensive players.\n    * dense_dp - connects all the defending players to each other and attacking players.\n  \n  * Choose the Edge features and Node Features using the checkboxes.\n    * Edge Feature options:\n      * Player Distance - Distance between two players connected to each other\n      * Speed Difference - Speed difference between two players connected to each other\n      * Positional Sine angle - Sine of the angle created between two players in the edge\n      * Positional Cosine angle - Cosine of the angle created between two players in the edge\n      * Velocity Sine angle - Sine of the angle created between the velocity vectors of two players in the edge\n      * Velocity Cosine angle - Coine of the angle created between the velocity vectors of two players in the edge\n      \n    * Node Feature options:\n      * x coordinate - x coordinate on the 2D pitch for the player / ball\n      * y coordinate - y coordinate on the 2D pitch for the player / ball\n      * vx - Velocity vector's x coordinate\n      * vy - Velocity vector's y coordinate\n      * Velocity - magnitude of the velocity\n      *  Velocity Angle - angle made by the velocity vector\n      * Distance to Goal - distance of the player from the goal post\n      * Angle with Goal - angle made by the player with the goal\n      * Distance to Ball - distance from the ball (always 0 for the ball)\n      * Angle with Ball - angle made with the ball (always 0 for the ball)\n      * Attacking Team Flag - 1 if the team is attacking, 0 if not and for the ball\n      * Potential Receiver - 1 if player is a potential receiver, 0 otherwise\n    \n  * Update the graph neural training network configurations as per your requirement. You may also try chaning the network layers.\n  * Start the model training. It should stop after the epochs are completed. Check your training logloss score. If it is not satisfactory rerun the training block.\n  * Use the block for testing model logloss and ROC-AUC curve. \n  * Further, you may opt to look at model calibration and also calculate the Expected Calibration Error (More details in the notebook text blocks).\n  * It is also possible to check which features contribute the most to the model performance. (**Note**: The ```Attacking Team Flag``` checkbox from the Node Features needs to be selected to calculate the feature importance.) Choose between attacking and defending players and note the differences via the box plot.\n\n## Research Ideas\n- Change the model architecture by introducing different configurations for the [Convolutional layers](https://graphneural.network/layers/convolution/), [Pooling layers](https://graphneural.network/layers/convolution/) and Hyper Parameters.\n- Choose different adjacency matrices and different combinations of node features and edge features.\n- Create a \"Gender-Aware\" model as suggested by [StatsBomb](https://statsbomb.com/articles/soccer/analytics-and-modelling-in-womens-football/). Perhaps this can be achieved by adding a node feature to each node in each graph specifying the gender.\n- Use the [Imbalanced Dataset](#datasets) to build a robust (gendered) counterattacking success prediction model \n- Analyze the features and their importance to counterattack success more in-depth. This can help uncover for example, for which players on what position it is important to have a high (or low) `vx` etc.\n- Analyze other aspects of counterattacks. For example: what is the impact of having more players behind the ball when defending, or how much is the impact of space reduction around the player on the ball.\n- etc. \n\n## Citation\n\nIf you use any of the data or files within this repository, please cite our paper.\n\n- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eerdAe8AAAAJ&citation_for_view=eerdAe8AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C)\n\n```text\n@inproceedings{sahasrabudhe2023graph,\n  title={A Graph Neural Network deep-dive into successful counterattacks},\n  author={Sahasrabudhe, Amod and Bekkers, Joris},\n  booktitle={17th Annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference.

Event Frames Only Balanced Dataset\nThis dataset is used within our research paper. It contains only Graph representations of tracking data frames that are associated with an event that happens\nwithin a counterattacking sequence. \n#### Samples:\n| Dataset  | Competitions                                                    | Sample Size  <br/>(Individual Graphs) |\n|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Women    | NWSL (2022) <br/>Int. Friendlies <br/>SheBelieves <br/>Olympics | 3,720                                 |\n| Men      | MLS (2022)                                                      | 17,143                                |\n| Combined | All                                                             | 20,863                                |\n#### Labels:\nEvery Graph of an event that is part of a counterattacking sequence where eventually the ball reaches the opposing team's penalty area is labeled a success (1).\n#### Balance:\nThis dataset has 50% successful and 50% unsuccessful labels.\n#### Structure:\n\n```text\n{\n  \"normal\": {\n    \"a\": [AdjMatrixGraph0, AdjMatrixGraph1, ... AdjMatrixGraphN],\n    \"x\": [NodeFeatureMatrixGraph0, NodeFeatureMatrixGraph1, ... NodeFeatureMatrixGraphNN],\n    \"e\": [EdgeFeatureMatrixGraph0, EdgeFeatureMatrixGraph1, ... EdgeFeatureMatrixGraphN]\n  }, <- similar dictionaries for each other Adjacency Matrix Type (\"delaunay\", \"dense\", \"dense_ap\", \"dense_dp\")\n  \"binary\": [[LabelGraph0], [LabelGraph1]...[LabelGraphN]]\n}\n```\nThe data loading process is automated within the [Counterattack Jupyter Notebook](counterattack.ipynb), but it can also be obtained through the links below.\n\n- [Counterattacks Women](https://ussf-ssac-23-soccer-gnn.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/counterattack/women.pkl)\n- [Counterattacks Men](https://ussf-ssac-23-soccer-gnn.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/counterattack/men.pkl)\n- [Counterattacks Combined](https://ussf-ssac-23-soccer-gnn.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/counterattack/combined.pkl)\n\n_Note: Node and Edge feature names for these datasets are listed in [Counterattack Jupyter Notebook](counterattack.ipynb)_\n\n### 2. Full Frames Imbalanced Dataset\nThis dataset is an _additional_ dataset that was **not** used within the research paper. \nIt contains Graph representations of every tracking data frame that is associated with a counterattacking sequence. \n\n#### Samples:\n| Dataset  | Competitions                                                    | Sample Size <br/>(Individual Graphs) |\n|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Women    | NWSL (2022) <br/>Int. Friendlies <br/>SheBelieves <br/>Olympics | 103,381                              |\n| Men      | MLS (2022, approx. 32% of games)                                | 104,628                              |\n#### Labels:\nEvery Graph frame that is part of a counterattacking sequence that leads to a goal is labeled a success (1).\n#### Balance:\nThis dataset has approx. 5% successful and approx. 95% unsuccessful labels.\n#### Structure:\nThe structure is slightly different, as we only provide the `normal` adjacency matrix. \n\nWe also provide an `id` label. This label number is the same for all frames that belong to the same sequence.\nUse this Sequence ID value to split the test & train data such that we do not add parts of a single sequence to both the test and train set.\nDoing this would result in leaking information between test and train set. To do this splitting see [split_sequences.py](split_sequences.py). \n```text\n{\n  \"a\": [AdjMatrixGraph0, AdjMatrixGraph1, ... AdjMatrixGraphN],\n  \"x\": [NodeFeatureMatrixGraph0, NodeFeatureMatrixGraph1, ... NodeFeatureMatrixGraphNN],\n  \"e\": [EdgeFeatureMatrixGraph0, EdgeFeatureMatrixGraph1, ...

        "repo": "/SweetzpotAS/StravaZpot-Android",
        "language": "Java",
        "readme_contents": "# StravaZpot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SweetzpotAS/StravaZpot-Android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SweetzpotAS/StravaZpot-Android)\n\nA fluent API to integrate with Strava on Android apps.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis document explains how to use **StravaZpot** in your Android app. For additional questions, you may want to check **Strava** official documentation [here](https://strava.github.io/api/).\n\n## Authentication\n\n### Login button\n\nStravaZpot includes a custom view to include a login button according to Strava guidelines. To do that, you can add the following code to your XML layout:\n\n```xml\n<com.sweetzpot.stravazpot.authenticaton.ui.StravaLoginButton\n    xmlns:app=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\"\n    android:id=\"@+id/login_button\"\n    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:layout_gravity=\"center\"\n    app:type=\"orange\"/>\n```\nThe custom attribute `type` accepts two different values: `orange` and `light` (default). `StravaLoginButton` makes use of vector drawables in the support library. Thus, if you are targeting version prior to Android API 21, you would need to add the following code to your Activity:\n\n```java\nstatic {\n    AppCompatDelegate.setCompatVectorFromResourcesEnabled(true);\n}\n```\n\n### Login Activity\n\nStrava uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users, and then request them to grant permission to your app. To get a Client ID and Secret from Strava for your app, follow [this link](https://www.strava.com/settings/api).\n\nOnce you have your app credentials, you can get an `Intent` to launch the login activity for your app. You can easily do it with:\n\n```java\nIntent intent = StravaLogin.withContext(this)\n                  .withClientID(<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>)\n                  .withRedirectURI(<YOUR_REDIRECT_URL>)\n                  .withApprovalPrompt(ApprovalPrompt.AUTO)\n                  .withAccessScope(AccessScope.VIEW_PRIVATE_WRITE)\n                  .makeIntent();\nstartActivityForResult(intent, RQ_LOGIN);\n```\n\nYou need to notice several things with this call:\n\n- `<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>` must be replaced with the Client ID provided by Strava when you registered your application.\n- `<YOUR_REDIRECT_URL>` must be in the domain you specified when you registered your app in Strava.\n- Refer to `ApprovalPrompt` enum to get more options for this parameter.\n- Refer to `AccessScope` enum to get more options for this parameter.\n- You need to launch the intent with `startActivityForResult` since the login activity will return a value that you will need later to obtain a token. If login to Strava was successful and the user granted permission to your app, you will receive a `code` that you can retrieve with:\n\n```java\n@Override\nprotected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n\n    if(requestCode == RQ_LOGIN && resultCode == RESULT_OK && data != null) {\n        String code = data.getStringExtra(StravaLoginActivity.RESULT_CODE);\n        // Use code to obtain token\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, you need to add the login activity to your manifest:\n\n```xml\n<activity\n    android:name=\"com.sweetzpot.stravazpot.authenticaton.ui.StravaLoginActivity\"\n    android:label=\"@string/login_strava\" />\n```\n\n### Obtain a Token\n\nEvery Strava API call needs a token to prove the user is authenticated and the app has permission to access the API. After you have obtained the code from user login, you need to exchange it with Strava to get a token. You can do it with the following code:\n\n```java\nAuthenticationConfig config = AuthenticationConfig.create()\n                                                  .debug()\n                                                  .build();\nAuthenticationAPI api = new AuthenticationAPI(config);\nLoginResult result = api.getTokenForApp(AppCredentials.with(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET))\n                        .withCode(CODE)\n                        .execute();\n\n```\nNotice that in this call you must provide the Client ID and Secret provided by Strava when you registered your application, and the code obtained during the login process. Also, the execution of the previous code involves a network request; **you are responsible for calling this code in a suitable thread, outside the UI thread**. Otherwise, you will get an exception.\n\nIf the previous request is successful, you will get a `LoginResult`, which has a `Token` that you can use in your subsequent API calls, and an `Athlete` instance, representing the authenticated user.\n\n### Deauthorize\n\n```java\nAuthenticationAPI api = new AuthenticationAPI(config);\nauthenticationAPI.deauthorize()\n                 .execute();\n```\n\n## Athlete API\n\n### StravaConfig\n\nBefore introducing the Athlete API, we have to talk about `StravaConfig`. `StravaConfig` is a class required by all the APIs in **StravaZpot** to configure the way it is going to interact with Strava. You can create a single instance of `StravaConfig` as soon as you obtain a token, and reuse it during your app lifecycle. To create an instance of `StravaConfig`:\n\n```java\nStravaConfig config = StravaConfig.withToken(TOKEN)\n                                  .debug()\n                                  .build();\n```\n\nYou must provide the token obtained during the authentication process. The call to `debug()` method will show in the Android Monitor what is going on when you do the network requests.\n\nOnce you have the configuration object, you can proceed to use all the APIs.\n\n### Create the Athlete API object\n\n```java\nAthleteAPI athleteAPI = new AthleteAPI(config);\n```\n\n### Retrieve current athlete\n\n```java\nAthlete athlete = athleteAPI.retrieveCurrentAthlete()\n                            .execute();\n```\n\n### Retrieve another athlete\n\n```java\nAthlete athlete = athleteAPI.retrieveAthlete(ATHLETE_ID)\n                            .execute();\n```\n\n### Update

.newCountry(COUNTRY)\n                            .newSex(Gender.FEMALE)\n                            .newWeight(WEIGHT)\n                            .execute();\n```\n\n### Retrieve athlete's

object\n\n```java\nUploadAPI uploadAPI = new UploadAPI(config);\n```\n\n### Upload a file\n\nStrava allows you to upload files with formats GPX, FIT or TCX. We recommend to use TCXZpot in order to generate TCX files that can be uploaded to Strava.\n\n```java\nUploadStatus uploadStatus = uploadAPI.uploadFile(new File(<path_to_file>))\n                                     .withDataType(DataType.FIT)\n                                     .withActivityType(UploadActivityType.RIDE)\n                                     .withName(\"A complete ride around the city\")\n                                     .withDescription(\"No description\")\n                                     .isPrivate(false)\n                                     .hasTrainer(false)\n                                     .isCommute(false)\n                                     .withExternalID(\"test.fit\")\n                                     .execute();\n```\n\n### Check upload status\n\n```java\nUploadStatus uploadStatus = uploadAPI.checkUploadStatus(16486788)\n                                     .execute();\n```\n\n## Threading\n\nAll the APIs in **StravaZpot** perform network requests in a synchronous manner and without switching to a new thread. Therefore, it is up to the user of the library to invoke the API in a suitable thread, and outside the Android UI thread in order to avoid `NetworkOnMainThreadException`.\n\n## Exceptions\n\n**StravaZpot** methods do not have any checked exceptions, but users of the library should be prepared for them to happen. In particular, the following scenarios can arise:\n\n- Strava may return a `401 Unauthorized` response code. In that case, the network request will throw a `StravaUnauthorizedException`. It is up to the user of the library to reuthenticate with Strava to get a new token and retry the request.\n- If any other network error happen, or the request is not successful, it will throw a `StravaAPIException`.\n\n## Download\n\nYou can get **StravaZpot** from JCenter using Gradle. Just add this line to your build file:\n\n```groovy\ncompile 'com.sweetzpot.stravazpot:lib:1.3.1'\n```\n\n## License\n\n\n    Copyright 2018 SweetZpot AS\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n"

Al\u00e9m da preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e9tica para se parecer com a plataforma, sem esquecer dos efeitos visuais e intera\u00e7\u00f5es, de forma a manter um padr\u00e3o de qualidade para o usu\u00e1rio. No meio do projeto foi necess\u00e1rio trocar do Google Chrome para o Firefox pois foi bloqueado o acesso a partir do Chrome. Mas no fim o Chrome foi novamente poss\u00edvel atrav\u00e9s do projeto [undected_chromedriver](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver).\n\n## Como utilizar\n1. Instale o python 3.9, e na raiz do projeto instale as [depend\u00eancias](./requirements.txt):\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n2. Certifique-se que tem uma conta na [Bet 365](https://www.bet365.com/), e pegue o seu nome de usu\u00e1rio e senha.\n3. Certifique-se que tem o [Firefox](./src/widgets.py) instalado com o seu respectivo [Gecko Driver](https://www.take.net/blog/wp-content/cache/wp-rocket/take.net/blog/take-test/instalacao-geckodriver-driver-para-abrir-o-firefox-no-selenium/index-https.html_gzip) no caso de usar o FirefoxBrowser, ou use o ChromeBrowser no [bot.py](./src/bot.py) com o chromedriver.\n4. Crie uma conta no [MongoDB](https://medium.com/reprogramabr/conectando-no-banco-de-dados-cloud-mongodb-atlas-bca63399693f#:~:text=Acesse%20ao%20site%20do%20MongoDB,esquerdo%2C%20clique%20em%20Database%20Access.), um Cluster para criar uma Database chamada [betbot](./src/database.py) com uma Collection chamada users.\n5.
